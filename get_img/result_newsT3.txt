            "title": "‘La Presidenta’: Claudia Sheinbaum wins historic Mexico election mandate",
            "summary": "The country’s first female president faces a raft of challenges, from crime to a fractured polity.\n\nMexico has elected Claudia Sheinbaum, a former mayor of the capital, as the country’s first female president after a heated election on Sunday, with the nation’s top election authority projecting a comfortable win for the 61-year-old physicist-turned-politician.\n\nSheinbaum, a protege of Mexico’s outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, is expected to win more than 58 percent of the national vote, the National Electoral Institute of Mexico (INE) said, in what is known as a “quick count” of the vote.\n\nHer win entrenches the governing Morena party’s hold over power in Mexico, six years after Lopez Obrador, also known by his initials AMLO, ran an anti-establishment campaign against the country’s traditionally mainstream parties to win the 2018 election.\n\n“I commit to you that I will not let you down,” Sheinbaum said, in a victory statement on X. “There is history, there is homeland, there is people, and there is commitment.”\n\nLate on Sunday night in Mexico, the principal opposition candidate, Xochitl Galvez, conceded defeat. A trained engineer with Indigenous roots, Galvez rose from poverty to become a tech entrepreneur.\n\n“A few minutes ago, I contacted … Sheinbaum to acknowledge the election result. I told her that I saw a Mexico with a lot of pain and violence and that I hope she can resolve the serious problems of our people,” she was quoted as saying by local media.\n\nDuring her campaign, Sheinbaum faced questions over her close ties to AMLO — a president who enjoys vast popularity in Mexico, despite critics accusing him of authoritarian tendencies — including whether she would be able to lead independently.\n\nHowever, Sheinbaum and Lopez Obrador have insisted that he would hold no influence over her government.\n\n“I am going to retire completely,” he said last year. “I will never again appear at any public event.”\n\n“I do not want to be anybody’s adviser … I will not have any relationship with politicians,” the president said, adding, “I am not going to talk about politics.”\n\nA mystery\n\nSheinbaum struggled to establish her identity in this campaign while under AMLO’s influence.\n\nWhile trying to convince Mexicans to vote for her, she has adhered closely to his policies, while also trying to assert her individuality. To many, Mexico’s first female president remains somewhat a mystery.\n\n“It’s complicated,” Juan Pablo Micozzi, an associate professor of political science at Mexico’s Autonomous Institute of Technology (ITAM), told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Her [political] trajectory has been practically an unconditional alignment with AMLO … So, it’s really hard for me to understand what Claudia is going to do on day one without AMLO in charge,” Micozzi added.\n\nHowever, there may be some clues in her early life, suggest other analysts.\n\nSheinbaum grew up in a family deeply engaged in activism, and her involvement began from a young age. At 15, she volunteered to assist groups of mothers searching for their missing children, while in the 1980s she also joined protests against state intervention in education policies.\n\nShe earned her PhD in energy engineering at the age of 33, and as she prepared her thesis, she spent time at the University of California, Berkeley in the United States.\n\nHer political journey started in 2000 when Lopez Obrador, then the newly elected mayor of Mexico City, selected her to serve as the leader of his environmental team.\n\nIn the years that followed, she actively campaigned for AMLO and developed her own academic and political career, including serving as the mayor of Tlalpan and then Mexico City.\n\n“I believe we can anticipate a presidency under Sheinbaum that is more disciplined than Lopez Obrador’s,” Carlos Ramirez, a political analyst at Integralia, a Mexico City-based consultancy, told Al Jazeera. “A more orderly presidency, a presidency with more planning, with a more technical profile among the officials who will surely accompany and surround her in her cabinet.”\n\nRamirez said he expects Sheinbaum to be a “president who better understands the world, unlike Lopez Obrador, whose vision has always been very provincial, very local”.\n\nNevertheless, she assumes leadership of a nation confronting a range of challenges — with security issues at the forefront.\n\n‘It’s a matter of state capacity’\n\nIn recent years, Mexico has seen more than 30,000 murders a year, and some 100,000 people are still unaccounted for.\n\nThe lead-up to the June 2 election was exceptionally violent, with 37 candidates killed and hundreds forced to withdraw from the race.\n\nAccording to the annual public survey conducted by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), six out of 10 Mexican citizens rate insecurity as their primary concern.\n\nHowever, during Sheinbaum’s time as Mexico’s City mayor, according to a Reuters report, the homicide rate fell 50 percent between December 2018 and June 2023. She credited this to successful security measures which enhanced police operations and collaboration with prosecutors.\n\nAt the federal level, Sheinbaum has expressed her intention to continue AMLO’s strategy of avoiding confrontation with crime groups, while also relying on the National Guard, which is operated by the military, for security operations.\n\n“They will have to continue using the army because … [no other] institution has the strength to face the potential problems associated with the cartels and organised crime groups,” Miguel Angel Toro Rios, dean of the School of Social Sciences and Government at Tecnologico de Monterrey, a Monterrey-based university, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It’s a matter of state capacity, and Mexico does not have the state capacity without the army to face these kinds of problems,” he added.",

            "title": "Judge Maryellen Noreika blocks key defense evidence and witness on eve of Hunter Biden gun trial",
            "summary": "Wilmington, Delaware CNN —\n\nThe federal judge overseeing Hunter Biden’s gun trial dealt his defense two setbacks Sunday, on the eve of jury selection, by blocking one of his expert witnesses and excluding a key piece of evidence the president’s son hoped to use.\n\nThe rulings from Judge Maryellen Noreika resolved some of the sticking points that were still simmering before the trial begins Monday. Taken together, these decisions could make a tough case for Hunter Biden even more challenging to win. President Joe Biden’s son has pleaded not guilty to illegally buying and owning a gun while abusing illicit drugs.\n\nNoreika granted a request from special counsel David Weiss to block one of Hunter Biden’s expert witnesses from testifying. The defense had lined up a Columbia University-based psychiatrist who would’ve tried to poke holes in prosecutors’ assertions that Hunter Biden knew he was an addict in 2018 when he bought the gun that led to his indictment.\n\n“The inadequacy of Defendant’s expert disclosure for Dr. (Elie) Aoun leaves the government in the dark as to what his opinions about the facts of this case will be, thus rendering the government unable to prepare for trial,” Noreika wrote in her ruling.\n\nThe judge also blocked Hunter Biden’s lawyers from using what they thought was a key piece of exculpatory evidence: an altered version of the federal firearms form he filled out when he bought the gun in 2018 that was tweaked in 2021 by the gun store employees.\n\nHunter Biden’s lawyers recently argued in court that they wanted to use the doctored form to undermine the credibility of the employees, who are slated to testify on behalf of the prosecutors. They also claimed it showed prosecutors were politically “biased.”\n\nBut Noreika ruled the altered version of the form was “irrelevant and inadmissible,” and she went on to blast Hunter Biden’s team for pushing “conspiratorial” theories and “unsupported rhetoric” about the motivations of the Wilmington gun store employees.\n\n“Any probative value it arguably has is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, and misleading the jury,” she wrote, further adding that any attempts by the defense to use the altered form to demonstrate the employees’ alleged political bias would have been “unduly prejudicial and invites (jury) nullification.”\n\nOnly the original form – known as ATF Form 4473 – will be shown to the jury.\n\nOn that form, Hunter Biden is accused of falsely swearing that he wasn’t using or addicted to drugs, which allowed him to purchase the gun. Prosecutors contend he was still addicted to crack cocaine at that time, as he has described in his memoir.\n\nJury selection for the trial is slated to begin Monday morning in Wilmington.",

            "title": "For Hunter Biden, a dramatic day with his brother’s widow led to charges",
            "summary": "Hallie Biden awoke on an October morning in 2018 after Hunter Biden, the brother of her deceased husband, Beau, had spent the night. While he slept, she dropped her two kids off at school and then returned to rummage through the truck he had parked outside, anxious as to what the admitted drug addict might be hiding.\n\nWhen she found a newly purchased Colt Cobra .38 handgun, she was hit by a wave of anger and fear. She put the gun in a shopping bag and drove a few miles to a high-end grocery store, where she tossed it into a trash can. That set off a chain of events that would trigger a flurry of frantic text messages, launch another dark chapter in a doomed and difficult romance — and lead to Hunter Biden’s federal trial beginning Monday.\n\nWhen Hallie told Hunter, whose father at the time was contemplating a run for the presidency, how she had disposed of the gun, he erupted. “Are you insane,” he texted furiously, according to documents submitted by prosecutors. “Tell me now. this is no game. And you’re being totally irresponsible and unhinged.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEight seconds later, he wrote again: “Tell me now.”\n\nHallie reacted with disbelief that Hunter Biden — a drug addict who’d just stashed a gun in a truck outside her home — was accusing her of recklessness. “Check yourself into a local rehab hunter, this has all got to stop,” she responded. “Don’t run away again. Please don’t leave.”\n\nShe had to go, she added. Police were arriving.\n\nThe text messages, submitted by federal prosecutors as part of their case against Hunter Biden for lying on a gun purchase form, reflect the tortured nature of a Biden family drama that unfolded after the death of Joe Biden’s son Beau of cancer in 2015.\n\nHallie was the grieving widow of Beau, the rising family star many expected to win the presidency himself. She and Hunter, Beau’s surviving brother, had a turbulent romantic relationship at a time when both were struggling and vulnerable; at one point, she wrote to him, “You want me to relapse.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn public, leading political figures and journalists were weighing Joe Biden’s presidential prospects and the chance that he could rescue the Democratic Party and end Donald Trump’s chaotic tenure. In private, according to text messages and people close to the family, accusations of betrayal and unfaithfulness multiplied as the family struggled to find its way out of a morass of drugs, grief and troubled love affairs.\n\nThe rash decisions Hunter and Hallie made that October day have now propelled him into court, enormously complicating a Biden reelection campaign that many Democrats believe will determine the future of American democracy. With prosecutors preparing to question Hallie Biden — and other women from Hunter Biden’s past — and to introduce personal text messages as evidence, the trial could spill deeply personal topics into the glare of the campaign.\n\nHunter Biden faces charges of lying on an official form when he bought the gun in 2018, falsely saying he was not using illegal drugs when in fact he was in the throes of addiction. Prosecutors have put Hallie, who had firsthand knowledge of both the gun purchase and Hunter’s addiction, on a list of witnesses they are prepared to call.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, the widow of President Biden’s beloved son Beau could be taking the witness stand as part of prosecutors’ effort to convict his surviving son, Hunter.\n\nThis account of the dramatic day that led to the federal charges is drawn from interviews, court records, police reports and, in some cases, the participants’ own memoirs. Attorneys for Hunter Biden and Hallie Biden declined to comment. The White House also declined to comment.\n\nPeople close to Hunter Biden say he has largely stabilized his life in the intervening six years, and they worry about the toll such a trial could take on someone who has struggled with addiction through much of his life. Hunter Biden’s ex-wife, Kathleen, who left the family orbit after Beau died and Hunter started a relationship with Hallie, is also on the witness list. She could not be reached for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAssociates say President Biden himself is worried about his son. He has ensured that on Monday he will be in Wilmington, Del., at his home just miles from the federal courthouse where the trial will unfold.\n\nA romance born in grief\n\nHallie Olivere grew up in Wilmington and knew the Biden family from an early age. Her mother, Joan, was a childhood friend of Joe Biden, and he once joked about trying to date her in high school (“I was the Catholic kid. She was the Jewish girl,” he said in September 2015. “I still tried. I didn’t get anywhere.”)\n\nHer parents owned a local dry-cleaning business, and she played field hockey at Tatnall School, a private school on the same leafy street where Joe Biden now lives. By the late 1990s, she was dating Beau Biden and often spending time with his brother, Hunter, and Hunter’s new wife, Kathleen.\n\nBeau proposed on Nantucket on Thanksgiving 2001, and the couple married in a small Catholic church on the island a year later, according to public accounts. The two Biden brothers, who as children survived the 1972 car crash that killed their mother and baby sister, now had growing families and successful careers. Hunter was a lawyer and lobbyist in Washington, and Beau would soon be fulfilling the family political legacy, becoming Delaware’s attorney general and setting his sights on the governorship and possibly one day the presidency.\n\nKathleen and Hallie bonded, sharing an interest in running and facing together the challenges of marrying into a prominent political family. When Kathleen discovered that Hunter was having an affair in 2014 after seeing photos on his iPad, Hallie was one of the few people she confided in, according to Kathleen’s 2022 memoir “If We Break.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“If you leave him, Kathleen, he’ll find someone else, and then you’ll have to live with that,” she recalled Hallie telling her. Kathleen confronted Hunter, and they began meeting with a therapist even as they were drifting apart.\n\nBut any equilibrium within the family was disrupted when Beau Biden, after several years of battling brain cancer, died on May 30, 2015.\n\nAs the family mourned, Kathleen grew suspicious of the time Hunter was spending with Hallie, but she felt guilty questioning his desire to support his brother’s family, she later wrote. Ultimately, her daughters found his phone, discovering the affair and telling their mother during a tearful exchange in a therapist’s office.\n\nSeveral months after Kathleen filed for divorce from Hunter in 2017, news broke in the New York Post that Hunter and Hallie were in a romantic relationship. Hunter issued a statement saying that he and Hallie were “incredibly lucky to have found the love and support we have for each other in such a difficult time.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHunter also urged his reluctant father to provide a statement as a way to break the news to the rest of the family, and to the world.\n\n“‘Dad,’ I told him, ‘if people find out, but they think you’re not approving of this, it makes it seem wrong,’” Hunter wrote in his memoir. “‘The kids have to know that there’s nothing wrong with this, and the one person who can tell them that is you.’”\n\nJoe Biden released a statement saying that the couple had his and his wife Jill’s “full and complete support.” “We are all lucky that Hunter and Hallie found each other as they were putting their lives together again after such sadness,” it said.\n\nHunter and Hallie rented a house in Annapolis, Md., trying to start a new life together.\n\nBut it was a complicated life. As Hunter and Hallie sought to support each other, they also served as reminders of the person both had loved and lost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it got even more complicated when something else was thrown into the mix: a gun.\n\nDepression, drugs and a gun\n\nLate in the afternoon of Oct. 12, 2018, a salesman was standing in the window of StarQuest Shooters & Survival Supply in Wilmington, which sits near ice cream and bicycle stores and across from a ballpark. Hunter Biden walked in, saying he was interested in purchasing a Colt Cobra revolver, according to court documents.\n\nThe store owner knew the Biden family lived a few miles away. He also knew that Joe Biden, sponsor of a federal assault weapons ban that passed in 1994, was not considered a gun rights supporter. The owner told federal prosecutors in a recent interview, a transcript of which was filed in court, that he wanted to complete the sale quickly, thinking it would be bad for business if Joe Biden’s son was known to be a customer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut first, Hunter needed to fill out a federally required form. It asked for his height, weight and birth date. He checked boxes declaring he was not a fugitive, had never been convicted of a felony and had never been committed to a mental institution.\n\nFinally, there was the box that is the subject of the upcoming trial: “Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?” Hunter marked “no.”\n\nThe store ran a criminal-background check that came back negative. Hunter provided his passport, but it is unclear whether he also supplied documentation of his address, as required by law. (Three years later, when the gun purchase became the focus of public scrutiny, store workers altered the original form to reflect that they had checked Hunter’s car registration for the address, according to the store owner, a move that defense attorneys may highlight at trial.)\n\nAt 6:53 p.m., a receipt shows, he bought the gun and several other items, including ammunition and a speed loader, paying $886.81 in cash.\n\nHe then went to a consignment store next door and bought more items. The gun salesman, according to an interview with federal agents, said an employee of the consignment store told him Hunter had purchased a rubber chicken. He “is not sure whether the employee was making a joke,” an FBI interviewer wrote, “or if Biden actually bought a rubber chicken.”\n\nEleven days later, on the morning of Oct. 23, Hallie Biden took her two children to school, dropping them off at 8 a.m. When she returned home, as Hunter slept inside, she searched his black pickup truck and found the handgun in the center console, according to police records. Around 11:20 a.m., she put it in a black shopping bag and drove her BMW to Janssen’s Market, a local institution frequented by the Bidens that offered baked goods, fresh flowers and high-end groceries.\n\nShe threw the handgun into a trash can and entered the store. A review of video footage showed that she bought beef, bread rolls and a bottled drink.\n\nWhen she returned home, she later said, Hunter’s car was gone, so she called and told him she had found his gun and thrown it into a trash can. He immediately became alarmed, angrily telling her to go retrieve it, text messages show.\n\nJust before noon, according to the video footage, Hallie arrived back at Janssen’s. She checked two trash cans, and when she could not find the gun, she approached the store owner and relayed what had happened.\n\nThe police were called and, by 12:56 p.m., opened a gun theft case, with Hunter listed as the victim and Hallie as the suspect, since she had taken the gun from his car and thrown it out.\n\nThe officer felt she was evasive when he asked whether it had been used in a crime and whether she also found drugs. “I found her to not be very reliable and she was kind of all over the place,” the officer wrote.\n\nHallie called Hunter, who also came to the store to talk to police, saying he’d kept the gun in the truck to avoid bringing it in Hallie’s house because of her children, court documents show. He wondered aloud whether store workers might have taken the gun from the trash can, pointing to two Latino men in Janssen’s Market shirts and saying, “Yea, prolly illegal.”\n\nThe police officer asked whether Hunter had told anyone about the incident, including his father. “I have never called my dad for anything,” he replied, according to the police report. “I have always handled my own affairs.”\n\nThe officer asked whether he was using drugs, floating that as a reason that Hallie was searching his truck.\n\n“Listen, it isn’t like that,” Hunter responded, according to the police report. “I think she believes I was gonna kill myself.”\n\nHe told the officer that he was living a nightmare, that he had fallen in love with his brother’s widow, and that he was depressed but in love.\n\nLashing out in anger\n\nHours later, Hunter turned on Hallie again for tossing the gun in a public place, especially one across from a public high school, text messages show.\n\nCursing the FBI, he wrote that the gun had been in a locked car, adding: “What more can I do than come back to you to try again. And you do this???? Who in their right mind would trust you would help me get sober?”\n\n“Do you want me dead,” he added.\n\n“I’m sorry. I just want you safe. That was not safe,” Hallie wrote back. “And it was open unlocked and windows down and the kids search your car.”\n\nThe police still had not found the gun, but investigators were chasing leads on an elderly man who often went through garbage bins in the area to collect recyclables. No one knew how to find him — until one day, employees of a local bank called the police and said he was there.\n\nWilmington Police Lt. Millard Greer arrived and watched the man for nearly an hour as he rummaged through trash receptacles, he wrote in his report. Eventually, Greer approached and struck up a conversation, telling the man that he was aware someone had recently placed something in a trash can that should not have been there.\n\n“Yes, they did,” the man said quickly.\n\nGreer asked him what it was. “A .38 Special,” the man responded.\n\nThe man had the gun back at his house, so he and Greer went to retrieve it. A leather pouch held the revolver and an ammunition box, as well as a box containing lip balm and a speed loader. Greer called and texted Hunter to let him know.\n\n“Mr. Biden was firm in his desire that there not be any prosecution for this case,” the officer wrote, meaning Hunter did not want Hallie charged for throwing out his gun. “He stated, ‘The whole thing is just stupid.’”\n\nThe next day, Oct. 30, top officials in the attorney general’s office decided that, without Hunter Biden’s cooperation, the stolen gun case should be closed.\n\nAnd now, six years later, as federal officials pursue an unrelated tax probe, they have charged the president’s son with lying about his drug use when he bought the gun.",

            "title": "Inside Hunter Biden's federal gun charges case in Delaware",
            "summary": "Hunter Biden's federal gun case to begin in Delaware\n\n54 minutes ago Bernd Debusmann Jr , BBC News, Washington Share\n\nGetty Images Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted of the federal charges in Delaware\n\nWith the strike of a judge's gavel in Delaware, Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden, will become the first child of a sitting president to be a criminal defendant. Prosecutors allege that the younger Biden, 54, lied about his drug use on application forms when he purchased a handgun in 2018. He faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted of the three federal counts, in a case that will get under way on Monday with jury selection. Mr Biden has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The trial - which comes as his father campaigns for re-election - is likely to see prosecutors delve into graphic details of Mr Biden's crack cocaine addiction, potentially providing fodder for the president's political foes. Here is what we know about the case.\n\nWhat are the charges?\n\nMr Biden is facing three federal charges in the case: two counts of making false statements and one count of illegal gun possession. The charges all relate to his purchase of a revolver at a Delaware gun store in October 2018, which he kept for about 11 days. By Mr Biden's own admission, he was deep in the throes of a \"full blown addiction\" to crack cocaine at the time. The two false statement charges stem from allegations that he lied about his drug use on a federally-mandated form when he purchased the weapon. Specifically, prosecutors allege that he falsely claimed that he was \"not an unlawful user of and addicted to any stimulant narcotic drug\" when he purchased a Colt Cobra Special revolver. The third count is related to his possession of a firearm while alleged to have been a drug user. The gun was discarded and discovered at a grocery store in Greenville, Delaware, prompting an investigation that ultimately led investigators back to the forms.\n\nWhat evidence is there in the case?\n\nTo convict Mr Biden, prosecutors will have to convince jurors that he knowingly made false statements on the form in a bid to deceive the store that sold him the pistol. Additionally, they will have to prove that Mr Biden was a drug user or addicted to drugs, and took possession of the gun despite knowing as much. US District Judge Maryellen Noreika has already ruled that defence lawyers cannot argue that the prosecution can only get a guilty verdict by proving Mr Biden was using drugs on the day he bought the weapon. Instead, in a pre-trial hearing, the judge agreed with prosecutors' argument that they need only prove that \"unlawful use (had) occurred recently enough to indicate that the individual (was) actively engaged in such conduct\". In court filings made ahead of the trial's start, prosecutors suggested that they would rely, in part, on deeply personal text messages and other communications made while Mr Biden was in the throes of addiction. In one such text message cited in court documents, Mr Biden refers to himself as a \"liar and a thief and a blame and a user and I'm delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know\". The prosecution is also expected to rely on the testimonies of witnesses including ex-wife Kathleen Buhle and Mr Biden's ex-partner Hallie Biden - who is also the widow of Mr Biden's brother Beau. Prosecutors will also be able to point to Mr Biden's own 2021 memoir, in which he detailed his experiences as a drug user who was \"up twenty-four hours a day, smoking every 15 minutes, seven days a week\". \"All my energy revolved around smoking drugs and making arrangements to buy drugs - feeding the beast,\" he wrote in the book.\n\nGetty Images Hunter Biden has repeatedly accused Republicans of using his addiction and recovery to \"embarrass\" and attack his father\n\nWhile Mr Biden has himself been quiet about the trial, legal documents filed by his lawyers suggest that they will focus on how much Mr Biden was aware of his addiction at the end of the purchase, and on the quality of the evidence itself. His primary attorney, Abbe Lowell, has sought permission from the court to call upon an expert witness who can testify about an addict's understanding of their substance abuse issues. “Someone, like Mr, Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict,” Mr Lowell wrote.\n\nInfamous laptop could feature\n\nAmong the most prominent pieces of evidence at the trial is likely to be the information on Mr Biden's infamous laptop, which has been the focus of intense media speculation and focus from conservative news outlets. The laptop has also been at the centre of unproven theories linking Mr Biden and his father to corruption, which they both deny. Mr Biden's own lawyers have argued that the computer was tampered with before it fell into the hands of investigators. The special counsel appointed to oversee the probes into Hunter Biden, David Weiss, has said that the tampering argument is a \"conspiracy theory\" with \"no supporting evidence.\" In a May filing, prosecutors wrote that the laptop contained \"significant evidence\" of Mr Biden's guilt.\n\nCould he go to prison if convicted?\n\nThe two false statement charges each carry a maximum sentence of up to 10 years, while the third count is punishable by up to five years - meaning that Mr Biden could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted. Actual sentences for federal crimes, however, are typically less than the maximum penalties specified by law. If Mr Biden is convicted, the judge in the case will ultimately determine the sentence after considering sentencing guidelines and a variety of other legal factors.\n\nHunter Biden's other charges",

            "summary": "Fires Evacuations relaxed, containment reaches 50% after Corral Fire burns 14,000 acres near Tracy\n\nA home burns Saturday in the Corral Fire at Bernard and Stearman roads, west of Tracy. The wildfire exploded to more than 12,000 acres burned several structures and shut down an interstate freeway southwest of Tracy. Evacuation orders remain in place. The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa\n\nAmid strong but seasonal winds, Firefighters on Sunday gained the upper hand after a wildfire exploded to 14,000 acres Saturday, burning at least one home and shutting down two freeways, before officials relaxed mandatory evacuations in an area southwest of Tracy.\n\nThe Corral Fire started around 3 p.m. Saturday along Corral Hollow Road on the border of Alameda and San Joaquin counties, on land used by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s Site 300, a facility that once developed explosives material and other ordnance. It was not clear what started the blaze, said Cal Fire’s Santa Clara unit, which is in unified command with Alameda County Fire Department teams.\n\nIn a 6 p.m. update, officials said the fire had scorched 14,168 acres and was 50% contained as crews worked through another day of southwesterly winds that push flames against a small residential area known as Par Country Estates along Interstate 580. The fire was burning 25 miles west of Modesto and 60 miles south of Sacramento.\n\n“Strong winds and dry grass have made it difficult to contain,” Cal Fire SCU said in its Sunday morning update. But, by afternoon, officials had made progress on the threat to homes in the area and emergency officials had downgraded mandatory evacuations to warnings. San Joaquin County officials said those warnings would go into effect at 6 p.m.\n\nTwo firefighters from the Alameda department were being treated for minor injuries Saturday, Cal Fire said.\n\nCal Fire SCU personnel work to cut off flames in the median of Interstate 580 south of Tracy during the Corral Fire on Saturday. The wildfire exploded to more than 12,000 acres burned several structures and shut down an interstate freeway southwest of Tracy. Evacuation orders remain in place. Kent Porter The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa\n\nRoadways reopen as conditions improve\n\nAround noon Sunday, both directions of Interstate 580 were reopened, reconnecting Interstate 5 — a major arterial between Southern California and Bay Area — with Altamont Pass. Caltrans District 10 officials said one eastbound lane would remain closed between I-205 and I-5 to buffer firefighting efforts. Highway 132 was also reopened after being shut down for about 17 hours.\n\nBetween the fire’s start and midnight, the wind-whipped blaze leaped to 10,000 acres and burned one home and several outbuildings and vehicles. The fire was able to cross the four-lane freeway on Saturday in several spots, Cal Fire perimeter maps showed. Crews responded by keeping the flames limited in an area close to the San Joaquin-Stanislaus county line. Other spot fires had nowhere to go once they reached the California Aqueduct.\n\nEight miles north, away from the winds and smoke that hung over the fire, an American flag wrapped around the flagpole outside Larch Clover Community Center in north Tracy.\n\nFive volunteers sat inside the community center next to tables filled with water bottles, Blue Diamond almonds and “flaming hot” beef jerky. Despite the provisions, only four people had come in for services on Sunday as of 11:30 a.m., a volunteer said.\n\nApproximately 25 evacuees had come in Saturday, mainly to get information, before moving on to area hotels.\n\nIn a morning update, firefighters said “weather conditions became more favorable for firefighters, allowing crews to make progress constructing and improving control lines.”\n\nA home on Vernalis Road in the Diablo Range foothills is seen intact Sunday after flames from the Corral Fire surrounded the property south of Tracy. Containment on the 14,000-acre wildfire rose mid-day Sunday to 30% as crews battled winds in strong vegetation along the I-580 corridor. Cal Fire SCU\n\nWinds were expected to remain gusty\n\nWinds in the area were fierce overnight — but not unusual for an area that’s dotted with wind turbines just to the north. At Altamont Pass, southwest winds hovered around 40 mph with gusts to 50 mph recorded about 3 a.m. Winds at the San Joaquin-Stanislaus county line were gusting to 25 mph, according to sensor readings collected by the National Weather Service.\n\nIdamis Shoemaker, a meteorologist at the weather service’s Sacramento office, said winds during the day were expected to remain between 20 and 30 mph but strong winds were expected to pick back up into the evening in the fire area.\n\nShoemaker said gusts in the general area of the fire could reach 35 mph, which is normal for this time of year as onshore breezes push over the coastal mountains and down into the Central Valley.\n\nA firefighting bulldozer cuts a fire line Saturday, June 1, 2024, to stop progress of the Corral Fire, a 12,500-acre grass fire burning in San Joaquin County. Strong winds had pushed the blaze up to homes and a freeway south of Tracy. Cal Fire SCU\n\nAs aerial crews flew in at daybreak to help the more than 400 personnel on the ground fight the blaze, ranch homes along Vernalis Road, just south of Highway 132 and near the Tracy Golf and Country Club, had been spared because of defensible space around their dwellings.\n\nOne home in the area had burned overnight, along with several outbuildings and an abandoned home and barn.\n\nThe San Joaquin County Office Of Emergency Services said it would relax the mandatory evacuations for areas west of the California Aqueduct, south of Corral Hollow Creek, west to the Alameda County line and south to the Stanislaus County line, around 6 p.m., allowing residents to return.\n\nA homeowner on Vernalis Road evacuates his horse Saturday as smoke from the Corral Fire bear down on ranches south of Tracy. The wildfire exploded to more than 12,000 acres burned several structures and shut down an interstate freeway southwest of Tracy. Evacuation orders remain in place. Kent Porter The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa\n\n‘We haven’t had one this close in a long time’\n\nChristine and Jamilyn Lewis drove out to Chrisman Road’s intersection with Durham Ferry Road, where the California Highway Patrol had closed traffic to the blackened hills beyond Sunday afternoon. The mother and daughter live about 5 miles from West Corral Hollow Road, where the fire started.\n\nJamilyn Lewis was out with friends Saturday when she saw smoke in the air and said, “Well, that’s not good.” Meanwhile, her mother began frantically packing a few days’ worth of clothes and dog food for their 4-month-old German Shepherd puppy, Harley, in case they needed to evacuate to a Tracy Wildlife Association campground.\n\n“My husband always has a bug-out bag, and he was all ‘I told you!’” Christine Lewis said. “We kind of threw our stuff together last night, and I was up until like 6 a.m.”\n\nThe fire reminded Lewis and her husband of living in the Bay Area during the 1991 Oakland Hills firestorm, which killed 25 people and destroyed more than 3,000 homes. She moved to Tracy months later, and hadn’t run into a similar blaze until Saturday.\n\n“We haven’t had one this close in a long time, and we’ve been out here 28 years,” she said.\n\nThe Lewis’ home was still safe as of Sunday afternoon, but Christine spoke to a friend at about 10 p.m. Saturday whose 500-acre ranch had burned up, decimating multiple structures. After that, she and her husband began preparing to load their Harley-Davidson motorcycles into a trailer in case of evacuation. Harley, the puppy, would ride with Jamilyn in the car.\n\nInvestigation of the blaze begins\n\nSeveral homes nearby remained without power after fire knocked down lines Saturday, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said. PG&E also said firefighters had asked for some lines to be de-energized. As many as 3,800 ratepayers were in the dark Saturday night, only about 160 remained interrupted, the utility said.\n\nAn evacuation shelter remained open at the Larch Clover Community Center, 11157 W. Larch Road. County officials also hosted an animal evacuation center at the Manteca Education & Training Center, 2271 W. Louise Ave.\n\nIn addition to the 60 engines, 12 water tenders and nine hand crews fighting flames, a team of investigators was on scene near Site 300 to begin investigating what sparked the fire, Cal Fire said.\n\nFire officials said previous prescribed burns in the area initially helped to slow the spread but no prescribed fire plans were started or burning on Saturday, said Cheryl Hurd, a spokesperson for Alameda County Fire.\n\nThis story was originally published June 1, 2024, 7:17 PM.",

            "summary": "South Africa president faces up to poor poll result\n\n13 hours ago Lou Newton , Nomsa Maseko Share\n\n\"The results reflect the will of the people,\" says President Ramaphosa\n\nSouth Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has admitted his African National Congress (ANC) party has suffered a challenging election result, after the party lost its majority for the first time since apartheid ended 30 years ago. The ANC, once led by Nelson Mandela, won 159 seats in the 400-seat parliament in Wednesday's election, down from 230 in the previous assembly. Mr Ramaphosa still described the results as a victory for democracy, calling on rival parties to find common ground - apparently preparing for coalition talks. The opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) party has said it is open to coalition talks with Mr Ramaphosa, but it opposes a number of his government's key priorities. With all the votes counted, the ANC finished on 40% - down from 58% at the previous election, the electoral commission announced on Sunday. This was lower than the party's feared worst-case scenario of 45%, analysts said. The ANC now must go into a coalition to form the next government.\n\n\"Our people have spoken, whether we like it or not, they have spoken,\" Mr Ramaphosa said. \"As the leaders of political parties, as all those who occupy positions of responsibility in society, we have heard the voices of our people and we must respect their wishes.\" He added that the voters wanted the parties to find common ground. \"Through their votes, they have demonstrated clearly and plainly that our democracy is strong and it is enduring,\" he said. South Africa's political parties will be aiming to work out a coalition deal within two weeks, when the new parliament sits for the first time. Can the ANC reinvent itself after dismal result?\n\nWho's up, who's down - and why The centre-right DA remains the second-largest party in parliament with 87 seats, and has said it is open to talks of a coalition. \"We urge all others who love our constitution and all it represents to set aside petty politics and narrow sectarian interests and join hands now,\" DA leader John Steenhuisen said. However, his party opposes two of the ANC's key priorities - its black empowerment policies, which aim to giving black people a stake in the economy following their exclusion during the racist apartheid era, and the National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill, which promises universal healthcare for all. The ANC has said both policies are non-negotiable in coalition talks. Former president Jacob Zuma, who now leads the uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party that came third with 58 seats, did not attend the results announcement and had suggested that he might challenge them. The MK has said it would be prepared to work with the ANC, but not while it was led by Mr Ramaphosa. He replaced Mr Zuma as both president and ANC leader following a bitter power struggle in 2018. In a BBC interview, Patrick Gaspard, who was the US ambassador to South Africa in 2013-16, described the two politicians as \"sworn enemies\". Earlier on Sunday, Mr Zuma called for an election rerun and said the electoral commission should not announce the final results. On Saturday, he warned the commission that it would \"be provoking us\" if it ignored his demand for a fresh election, and for an independent investigation into his party's claims that it was rigged. \"Don’t start trouble when there is no trouble,” he said. There are now concerns over how Mr Zuma's supporters may respond to the results.\n\nThe 82-year-old has been the political wildcard in this election - and he is preparing to flex his muscles as the kingmaker in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal, where the MK party has wrestled a huge chunk of votes from the ANC. Formed just a few months ago, it was the biggest party in the province - getting 44% to the ANC's 19%. Local issues could have been a big factor in that shift, with some community members turning their backs on the ANC because it had failed to fix acute water shortages. Parts of the province, such as Trenance Park, which is a mere 20 minutes' drive from the main city of Durban, have had no tap water for 10 months. Residents rely on water tankers that sometimes do not deliver water on time. People in KwaZulu-Natal hope that now the election is over, the problem will be fixed for good.\n\nEarlier, South Africa's police chief warned that threats to destabilise the country would not be tolerated. \"There cannot be any room for threats of instability in order to register objections or concerns about the electoral processes,\" Police Minister Bheki Cele said at a news conference.",

            "title": "South Africa’s president urges parties to find common ground in talks after election deadlock",
            "summary": "JOHANNESBURG (AP) — President Cyril Ramaphosa called Sunday for South Africa’s political parties to overcome their differences and find “common ground” to form the first national coalition government in its young democracy.\n\nHis comments came in a speech straight after final election results were announced confirming that no party won a majority in last week’s vote. Unprecedented coalition talks were set to start to find a way forward for Africa’s most industrialized economy.\n\nRamaphosa’s African National Congress party had already lost its 30-year majority after more than 99% of votes were counted by Saturday and showed it couldn’t surpass 50%. The ANC received 40% of the votes in last week’s election in the final count, the largest share.\n\nWithout a majority it will need to agree on a coalition with another party or parties for the first time to co-govern and reelect Ramaphosa for a second term. South Africa’s national elections decide how many seats each party gets in Parliament and lawmakers elect the president later.\n\n“Our people have spoken,” Ramaphosa said. “Whether we like it or not, they have spoken. We have heard the voices of our people and we must respect their choices and their wishes. ... The people of South Africa expect their leaders to work together to meet their needs. This is a time for all of us to put South Africa first.”\n\nThe ANC was the party of Nelson Mandela and freed South Africa from the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994. It had governed with a comfortable majority since then, but this election saw an unprecedented slump in its support as voters deserted the party due to its failure to solve widespread poverty, extremely high unemployment levels and problems with delivering basic government services to many in a nation of 62 million.\n\nThe ANC had said earlier Sunday that it was starting its negotiations with all major parties. More than 50 parties took part in the election, and at least eight had significant shares of the vote. At least 26 of them, including the MK Party led by former President Jacob Zuma, have lodged objections and complaints with the electoral body alleging voting irregularities, which it has promised to address.\n\nANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula said it was open to all negotiations, even with the main opposition Democratic Alliance, which has led the chorus of criticism of the ANC for years but is viewed by many analysts as the most stable coalition option for South Africa.\n\nThe DA won the second most votes with 21.8%, and the two parties would hold a majority together and be able to govern. DA leader John Steenhuisen said his party was also initiating talks with parties. The ANC won 159 seats in the 400-seat Parliament, down from the 230 it won in the last election. The DA increased slightly to 87 seats.\n\nThere is some time pressure for coalition talks to progress and for the uncertainty to be minimized, given that the new Parliament needs to sit for the first time and elect a president within 14 days of the election results being declared.\n\nRamaphosa is seeking a second and final term and Mbalula said his position as leader of the ANC was not in question despite the election result. Mbalula said the ANC would not consider the demands by Zuma’s MK Party that Ramaphosa step down as a condition for talks.\n\n“No political party will dictate terms to us, the ANC. They will not ... You come to us with that demand, forget (it),” Mbalula said.\n\nHe said the ANC would not be arrogant, though. “The elections have humbled us, they have brought us where we are,” he said.\n\nSouth Africa is a leading voice for its continent and for the developing world on the global stage and is due to take over the presidency of the Group of 20 rich and developing nations late this year. It’s the only African nation in that group.\n\n“Everyone is looking to see if South Africa can weather the storm and come out the other side,” political analyst Oscar van Heerden said on the eNCA news network.\n\nAmid many coalition options, the ANC could also join with MK and the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters, although they have been cast as partners that would make investors uneasy. Both have pledged to nationalize parts of South Africa’s economy, including its gold and platinum mines, among the world’s biggest producers.\n\nThe DA has long said it will not work with the EFF and MK, calling them a “doomsday coalition” for South Africa. Steenhuisen, the party’s leader, repeated that stance Sunday in a speech on national television but said his party was starting talks with others and would approach them “with cool heads and open minds.”\n\nPolitical analyst van Heerden said an ANC-DA coalition would “possibly give stability” but there were some within the ANC who would oppose it. Other smaller parties could be involved to dilute it and make it more palatable for the ANC, some commentators said.\n\n“The DA has approached the ANC as the enemy over many, many years,” van Heerden said. “The next few days is going to be a very difficult period. People will have to be mature behind closed doors.”\n\n___\n\nImray reported from Cape Town, South Africa.\n\n___\n\nAP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa",

            "summary": "Multiple news accounts have cited Trump’s age (he’ll be 78 at sentencing) as a reason not to send him to jail. It’s unusual, apparently, for 78-year-olds who falsify documents in the first degree to get jail time. This thinking requires updating. We also used to think it inadvisable for people older than 75 to run for president. The primary voters have spoken otherwise. If Trump is spry enough to serve a second term, he’s spry enough to do hard time.\n\nNews accounts have also noted that first offenders who falsify documents in the first degree seldom get jail time. Let us pause for a moment to appreciate how remarkable it is that a sociopath like Trump reached the advanced age of 77 before he received his first felony conviction. Bravo, Mr. President! That said, Trump has been pronounced a lawbreaker in too many previous civil proceedings to count. Just this year, Trump was found guilty of sexually abusing and defaming E. Jean Carroll in one such proceeding and defrauding banks in another. This second ruling is especially relevant to the hush money case, given the common theme of deception. Fraud is a persistent refrain in anti-Trump litigation; seven years ago, you’ll recall, Trump paid $25 million to settle fraud claims against his bogus Trump University. Do you seriously expect Justice Merchan not to connect these dots? Past history and character, Eisen wrote, are legitimate matters for a sentencing judge to take into consideration, and in Trump’s case these cry out for jail time.\n\nA final difference is the stakes. In those previous instances where New York State defendants falsified business records, the motive was theft, which is bad. Trump’s falsifications played out on a much larger stage. This crime, Eisen has observed, “could be seen not just as unfortunate personal judgment but also, as Merchan has described it, an attempt ‘to unlawfully influence the 2016 presidential election.’” Trump’s defenders say the New York criminal case was brought for political reasons. Of course it was! Trump’s falsifications may have put him in the White House! That makes Bragg’s decision to proceed with the case more defensible, not less.",

            "summary": "CNN —\n\nTwo far-right Israeli ministers have threatened to resign and bring down the governing coalition of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he accepts a peace proposal laid out by US President Joe Biden.\n\nBiden unveiled on Friday what he said was a three-phase Israeli proposal to end the conflict in Gaza that would pair a release of hostages with a “full and complete ceasefire.”\n\nDuring a speech at the White House, Biden said Hamas had been degraded to a point where it could no longer carry out the type of attack seen on October 7 that launched the current war in Gaza.\n\n“It’s time for this war to end,” he said, a clear indication that – as far as he is concerned – Israel’s war goals have been met.\n\nBut the Israeli government’s two most prominent far-right members, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, made it explicitly clear they reject an immediate ceasefire. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also signaled he is not ready either, casting doubt over Biden’s proposal.\n\nIn a statement on social media, Smotrich said he had “made it clear” to Netanyahu that he would not “be part of a government that will agree to the proposed outline and end the war without destroying Hamas and returning all the hostages.”\n\nSmotrich demanded the fighting to continue until the “destruction of Hamas and the return of all the hostages,” as well as the “creation of a completely different security reality in Gaza and Lebanon.”\n\nNational Security Minister Ben Gvir meanwhile described the deal as “reckless” and “a victory for terrorism,” as well as a security danger to Israel.\n\n“If the prime minister implements the reckless deal under the conditions published today, which mean the end of the war and the giving up on the elimination of Hamas, Otzma Yehudit will dissolve the government,” he said, referring to the far-right party he leads and which helps prop up Netanyahu’s majority in parliament.\n\nBiden had alluded to the tensions in the Israeli government in his speech, making a direct appeal to ordinary Israelis to voice their support.\n\n“I know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan and will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some, some are even in the government coalition,” he said.\n\nNetanyahu under pressure\n\nThe proposal would first see hostages freed and Israel withdrawing from “all populated areas of Gaza,” and eventually culminate in a reconstruction plan for Gaza, which has been left in ruins from the fighting.\n\nThe plan has been widely welcomed, with the UN and other international powers urging Israel and Hamas to accept it.\n\nHamas said it viewed the plan “positively” and was ready “to deal positively and constructively with any proposal based on a permanent ceasefire.”\n\nLess than an hour after Biden detailed the proposal, Netanyahu insisted Israel will not end the war in Gaza until it had achieved all of its goals, including the destruction of Hamas.\n\nThe extent to which Netanyahu agrees with the plan is unclear, as the statement also said that the “exact outline” of Israel’s proposal allows Israel to “maintain these principles.”\n\nOn Sunday, the Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant warned Israel will “not accept” any deal to end the war which would allow Hamas to rule over Gaza. During a visit to the Israeli military’s Southern Command headquarters on Sunday, Gallant said options for a “governing alternative to Hamas” are being considered.\n\n“We will not accept the rule of Hamas in Gaza at any stage in any process aimed at ending the war,” Gallant said, according to a readout from his office.\n\nHowever, Hamas has made it clear it will not accept any other group governing Gaza. On May 16, the group’s political leader Ismail Haniyeh noted that, in regards to “the day after the war,” there had been “calls to remove Hamas.”\n\n“We say that Hamas is here to stay,” Haniyeh responded.\n\nOn Sunday the White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the administration was currently “waiting for an official response from Hamas” on the Israeli ceasefire proposal.\n\nPressed on whether there would be a situation in which Hamas would agree to the proposal but Israel would not, speaking on ABC’s “This Week” Kirby said that the Biden administration has “every expectation” that Israel would agree.\n\n“We have every expectation that if Hamas agrees to the proposal, as was transmitted to them, an Israeli proposal, that Israel would say yes,” Kirby added.\n\nNetanyahu faces pressure from more than just within his own coalition. On Saturday protesters again took to the streets, demanding his resignation and early elections.\n\nIsraeli opposition leader Yair Lapid has offered to back Netanyahu in accepting the proposal, and condemned the comments by Smotrich and Ben Gvir.\n\n“The threats of Ben Gvir and Smotrich are the neglect of national security, of the hostages and of the residents of the north and the south,” he said.\n\n“This is the worst and most reckless government in the country’s history. For them, there will be a war here forever, zero responsibility, zero management, a complete failure.\n\nNetanyahu’s government is facing growing international calls to end the war in Gaza as the conflict approaches its ninth month.\n\nThe war was triggered by Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians on October 7, which left around 1,200 people dead and saw more than 200 people taken hostage.

Since then, over 36,000 Palestinians and more than 600 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the ongoing war, while an estimated 84 people are still being held hostage in Gaza, according to multiple news outlets.\n\nBiden’s plan calls for a ceasefire, the release of both Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners as well as the reconstruction of Gaza, which has seen 75% of its population displaced because of the war.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about Biden’s three-phase plan and how Israeli and Palestinian leaders are responding to it.\n\n💡 Phase 1: A 6-week ceasefire\n\nThe first phase calls for an immediate “full and complete ceasefire” lasting for six weeks. It will also demand the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza as well as the release of “a number of hostages” — including women, the elderly, the wounded and several U.S. citizens — in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.\n\nDuring this time, “humanitarian assistance would surge with 600 trucks carrying aid into Gaza every single day,” said Biden, who added that the ceasefire will continue even if negotiations last longer than the planned six weeks. The U.S., Egypt and Qatar will also work together to ensure “all the agreements are reached.”\n\n💡💡 Phase 2: The release of all hostages and full Israeli withdrawal\n\nThe second phase calls for the Israeli military to fully withdraw from Gaza in exchange for the release of all remaining living hostages — including male soldiers. If Hamas abides by everything outlined in the plan, Biden explained, Israel said it may agree to the “cessation of hostilities permanently,” meaning that all warfare and violence will be stopped indefinitely.\n\n💡💡💡 Phase 3: The reconstruction of Gaza\n\nThe final phase of the plan is for Gaza to undergo “a major reconstruction” to rebuild its cities — including homes, schools and hospitals that were destroyed by warfare, said Biden. Arab nations and the international community would also participate in a manner that “does not allow Hamas to rearm.”\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (Abir Sultan/Pool Photo via AP)\n\n💯 Netanyahu wants all or nothing\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said on Friday that it had “authorized” the text of Biden’s proposal.\n\nBut Netanyahu stressed on Saturday that Israel would not agree to a ceasefire unless Hamas’s military and governing capabilities are totally destroyed, all hostages are freed and “Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel.” To suggest an immediate ceasefire without those goals is a “non-starter,” Netanyahu said in a statement on X.\n\nNetanyahu’s chief foreign policy adviser, Ophir Falk, clarified the statement with Britain’s Sunday Times, reiterating that Israel’s conditions for a ceasefire “have not changed” and that while Biden’s plan “is not a good deal,” they’re hoping for a swift solution.\n\n👍👎 Israeli leaders are divided\n\nFar-right leaders — Israeli’s Minister of Finance Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir — agree with Netanyahu that an immediate ceasefire should be contingent on the destruction of Hamas. If the prime minister moves forward with the plan, Ben-Gvir said in a post on X, Israel’s far-right Otzma Yehudit party would make plans to “dissolve the government.”\n\nMeanwhile, Israel’s War Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz and opposition leader Yair Lapid support the plan and have urged Israeli leaders to discuss “next steps” as soon as possible, reports the Times of Israel.\n\nGantz had previously threatened to step down by June 8 if no plan for a ceasefire was agreed upon.\n\nBenny Gantz, a key member of Israel's war Cabinet and the top political rival of Netanyahu.

Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\n➕ Hamas views Biden's plan 'positively'\n\nOn Friday, Hamas said that it viewed Biden’s plan “positively” and that its willingness to move forward with it is solely “based on a permanent ceasefire” and the “complete withdrawal” of Israeli forces from Gaza, according to the Washington Post.\n\n❓ Who else supports Biden's plan?\n\nThe United States, Egypt and Qatar released a joint statement on Saturday supporting the plan, saying that it would bring “immediate relief both to the long-suffering people of Gaza as well as the long-suffering hostages and their families.”\n\nFamily members of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza have called on Netanyahu to publicly support Biden’s plan, reports Al Jazeera, with the Hostage and Missing Families Forum urging “citizens of Israel to take to the streets” to ensure it happens.\n\nOn a call with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan on Friday night, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken “emphasized that Hamas should accept the deal and that every country with a relationship with Hamas should press it to do so without delay.”",

He said on his TalkTV show: “Have you lost your minds, America? What a demeaning way to treat a former president.”\n\nMorgan also said he believes that Trump being found guilty would “almost guarantee” his victory in the forthcoming election and, after news of the verdict broke, the broadcaster claimed that “Trump’s donation websites are crashing”, adding: “My guess is this verdict will propel him back into the White House.”\n\nWatch Apple TV+ free for 7 days New subscribers only. £8.99/mo. after free trial.

            "summary": "A plurality of Americans, 50%, think former President Donald Trump's guilty verdict on all 34 counts in his hush money trial was correct, a new ABC News/Ipsos poll finds, and almost as many, 49%, think he should end his 2024 presidential campaign over the result.\n\nStill, following the historic criminal trial that ended this week in a first-ever conviction of a former president, Trump's favorability has remained stable at 31%, according to the latest ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted using Ipsos' KnowledgePanel. Trump was found guilty of 34 counts on Thursday in his trial related to falsifying business records regarding a payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election in order to keep her quiet about their alleged affair.\n\nThe former president has vowed to appeal, saying on Friday that \"bad people\" had levied the case – and charges– against him.\n\nFormer President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump walks to speak to the press after he was convicted in his criminal trial at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York City, on May 30, 2024. Justin Lane/POOL/AFP via Getty Images\n\nForty-seven percent of Americans said they think the charges against Trump in this case were politically motivated, while 38% say they were not. At the same time, the slight majority at 51%, think Trump intentionally did something illegal in this case. Twelve percent think Trump did something wrong but not intentionally, and 19% believe he did not do anything wrong.\n\nThe proportion of Americans who say Trump should end his presidential campaign as a result of this verdict is 49%, which is similar to findings from an April 2023 ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted shortly after the Manhattan grand jury handed down the indictment against him in this case. In the April 2023 polls, 48% thought he should suspend his campaign because of the indictment.\n\nBiden's favorability rating also remains low and unchanged, according to the new ABC News/Ipsos poll. His favorability rating currently stands at 32% compared to 33% in an ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted in March 2024. Public reaction to Trump's guilty verdict falls along partisan lines. For example, 83% of Democrats think the verdict was correct and 79% think he should end his campaign as a result, while only 16% of Republicans say the verdict was correct and the same percentage say he should end his presidential bid.\n\nBecause both Biden and Trump are broadly viewed unfavorably, the election could come down to independent voters, or even more specifically, those who dislike both candidates – sometimes referred to as double-haters.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump Getty Images\n\nA majority of Independents think Trump's verdict was correct, 52%, and the same amount believe that he should end his candidacy. For double-haters, those reactions are even more pronounced -- 65% of Americans who view both Trump and Biden unfavorably think the verdict this week was correct, with 67% believing Trump should end his presidential campaign.\n\nForty-five percent of Independents and 51% of double-haters think the hush-money trial was politically motivated, compared to 83% of Republicans and 20% of Democrats.\n\nIn the New York trial, Trump's attacks are largely directed at the district attorney, the judge and the jury -- all of which he's claimed are unfairly politically biased against him. Trump has also come after President Biden, claiming without evidence, that he was behind the prosecution.\n\n\"If they can do this to me, they can do this to anyone,\" Trump said during a press conference at Trump Tower in Manhattan. \"These are bad people. These are, in many cases, I believe, sick people.\" Biden, in his own remarks later on Friday, pushed back that the rule of law was \"reaffirmed\" and statements questioning the legitimacy of the process were \"dangerous.\"\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nThis ABC News/Ipsos poll was conducted using the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel® May 31-June 1, 2024, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 781 U.S. adults. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.7 points, including the design effect, for the full sample. Sampling error is not the only source of differences in polls.

            "summary": "Seoul, South Korea — Seoul will fully suspend a 2018 tension-reducing military deal with nuclear-armed North Korea, the South's National Security Council said Monday, after Pyongyang sent hundreds of trash-filled balloons across the border.\n\nSeoul partially suspended the agreement last year after the North put a spy satellite into orbit, but the NSC said it would tell the cabinet \"to suspend the entire effect of the 'September 19 Military Agreement' until mutual trust between the two Koreas is restored.\"\n\nIn the last week, Pyongyang has sent nearly a thousand balloons carrying garbage including cigarette butts and likely manure into the South in what it says was retaliation for missives bearing anti-regime propaganda organized by activists in the South.\n\nSouth Korean soldiers examine various objects including what appeared to be trash from a balloon believed to have been sent by North Korea, in Incheon, South Korea, on June 2, 2024. YONHAP NEWS AGENCY\n\nSouth Korea has called the latest provocation from its neighbor \"irrational\" and \"low-class\" but, unlike the spate of recent ballistic missile launches, the trash campaign doesn't violate U.N. sanctions on Kim Jong Un's isolated government.\n\nThe North called off the balloon bombardment Sunday, saying it had been an effective countermeasure, but warned that more could come if needed.\n\nThe 2018 military deal, signed during a period of warmer ties between the two countries that remain technically at war, aimed to reduce tensions on the peninsula and avoid an accidental escalation, especially along the heavily fortified border.\n\nBut after Seoul partially suspended the agreement in November last year to protest Pyongyang's successful spy satellite launch, the North said it would no longer honor the deal at all.\n\nAs a result, Seoul's NSC said the deal was \"virtually null and void due to North Korea's de facto declaration of abandonment\" anyway, but that abiding by the remainder of it was disadvantaging the South in terms of their ability to respond to threats like the balloons.\n\nRespecting the agreement \"is causing significant issues in our military's readiness posture, especially in the context of a series of recent provocations by North Korea that pose real damage and threats to our citizens,\" it said.\n\nThe move will allow \"military training in the areas around the Military Demarcation Line,\" it said, and enable \"more sufficient and immediate responses to North Korean provocations.\"\n\nThe decision needs to be approved by a cabinet meeting set for Tuesday before it takes effect.\n\nTies between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with diplomacy long stalled and Kim Jong Un ramping up his weapons testing and development, while the South draws closer Washington, its main security ally.\n\nSeoul's decision to jettison the 2018 tension-reducing deal shows \"that it will not tolerate trash balloons coming across the border, considering international norms and the terms of the truce,\" said Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul.\n\n\"However, it could further provoke Pyongyang when it is impossible to physically block the balloons drifting southwards in the air,\" he said.\n\nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the balloons weren't found to contain hazardous materials but had been landing in northern provinces, including the capital Seoul and the adjacent area of Gyeonggi, that are collectively home to nearly half of South Korea's population.\n\nSouth Korean officials have also said Seoul wouldn't rule out responding to the balloons by resuming loudspeaker propaganda campaigns along the border with North Korea.\n\nIn the past, South Korea has broadcast anti-Kim propaganda into the North, which infuriates Pyongyang, with experts warning a resumption could even lead to skirmishes along the border.\n\n",

            "summary": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea announced Monday it’ll suspend a rapprochement deal with North Korea to punish it over its launches of trash-carrying balloons, even after the North said it would halt its balloon campaign.\n\nOver several days, North Korea flew hundreds of balloons to drop trash and manure on South Korea in an angry reaction against previous South Korean civilian leafleting campaigns. On Sunday, South Korea said it would take “unbearable” retaliatory steps in response, before North Korea abruptly announced it would stop flying balloons across the border.\n\nOn Monday, South Korea’s presidential national security council said it has decided to suspend a 2018 inter-Korean agreement aimed at easing frontline animosities, until mutual trust between the two Koreas is restored, according to the presidential office.\n\nThe security council said the suspension would allow South Korea to resume military drills near the border with North Korea and take effective, immediate responses to provocations by North Korea. It said a proposal on the suspension will be introduced at the Cabinet Council on Tuesday for approval.\n\nObservers say South Korea needs the deal’s suspension to restart blasting anti-Pyongyang propaganda broadcasts, K-pop songs and outside news from border loudspeakers. They say such broadcasts have previously stung in the rigidly controlled North, where most of its 26 million people are not allowed official accesses to foreign news.\n\nThe 2018 agreement, reached during a brief period of reconciliation between then-liberal South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, require the Koreas to cease all hostile acts against each other, including propaganda broadcasts and leafleting campaigns.\n\nBut the accord doesn’t clearly state civilian leafleting should also be banned. That has allowed South Korean activists to continue to fly balloons to drop anti-Pyongyang leaflets, USB sticks with South Korean dramas and world news, and U.S. dollars in North Korea. Enraged over such leafleting campaigns, North Korea has previously fired at incoming balloons and destroyed a South Korean-built, unoccupied inter-Korean liaison office in the North.\n\nThe 2018 deal has already been in the danger of collapsing. Tension spiked after North Korea’s spy satellite launch last November prompted both Koreas to take steps in breach of the accord — South Korea resuming frontline aerial surveillance and North Korea restoring border guard posts.\n\nSince last Tuesday, a total of about 1,000 North Korean balloons carrying manure, cigarette butts, scraps of cloth and waste paper have been discovered in various parts of South Korea. No hazardous substances were found, according to South Korea’s military.\n\nOn Sunday night, Kim Kang Il, a North Korean vice defense minister, said the North would stop its balloon campaign because it left the South Koreans with “enough experience of how much unpleasant they feel.” He said North Korea will fly balloons again if South Korean activists restart their own balloon activities.\n\nExperts say North Korea’s balloon campaign, reportedly the first of its kind in seven years, is meant to trigger a divide in South Korea over its current conservative government’s tough policy on the North. Since 2022, North Korea has dramatically ramped up its weapons tests in what analysts call an attempt to bolster its nuclear capability and increase its leverage in future diplomacy with the U.S.",

He described those efforts as crucial for countering U.S. and South Korean military activities, state media said Wednesday.\n\nNORTH KOREA FLIES BALLOONS CARRYING GARBAGE OVER SOUTH KOREA FOLLOWING FAILED SATELLITE LAUNCH\n\nThe wire reported observers' claims that South Korea was likely going to restart front-line loudspeaker broadcasts into North Korea, criticizing the country for violating human rights while also broadcasting world news and K-pop songs.\n\nNorth Korean leaders are sensitive to the broadcasts because most of the 26 million people living in the country do not have access to radio programs and foreign television.\n\nKim Kang II, a North Korean vice defense minister, said Sunday that the country would temporarily suspend the balloon activities, adding they were a countermeasure against the South’s leafleting campaigns.\n\n\"We made the ROK (Republic of Korea) clans get enough experience of how much unpleasant they feel and how much effort is needed to remove the scattered wastepaper,\" Kim said in a statement carried by state media.\n\nNORTH KOREA TEST-FIRES SUSPECTED MISSILES AFTER US, SOUTH KOREA CONDUCT FIGHTER JET DRILL\n\nHe also said if South Korean activists send more anti-Pyongyang leaflets via balloons into North Korea again, they will resume flying balloons to dump rubbish hundreds of times the amount of South Korean leaflets found in the North.\n\nSouth Korea’s military said on Sunday that more than 700 balloons were found in various parts of the country, plus another nearly 260 balloons found days earlier.\n\nTied to the balloons, the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, was manure, cigarette butts, scraps of cloth, waste paper and vinyl. No dangerous substances were said to be included.\n\nDespite the South's claims that only about 1,000 balloons were launched, North Korea's vice defense minister said 3,500 balloons were launched carrying 15 tons of waste.\n\nNORTH KOREA ISSUES NUCLEAR 'WARNING SIGNAL' TO US, SOUTH KOREA\n\nChang Ho-jin, South Korea’s national security director, said Sunday that the government decided to take \"unbearable\" measures against North Korea in retaliation for balloon launches, alleged jamming of GPS navigational signals in South Korea and simulation of nuclear strikes against the South.\n\nExperts say North Korea’s balloon campaign, reportedly the first of its kind in seven years, is meant to stoke an internal divide in South Korea over its conservative government’s tough policy on the North.\n\nAnimosity between the Koreas is at its worst level in years as the pace of both Kim's weapons demonstrations and South Korea’s combined military exercises with the U.S. and Japan have intensified since 2022.\n\nThe failed satellite launch was a setback to Kim’s plan to launch three more military spy satellites in 2024 after North Korea’s first military reconnaissance satellite was placed in orbit last November. The November launch followed two failed attempts.\n\nJUSTICE DEPT MAKES ARRESTS IN NORTH KOREA IDENTITY THEFT SCHEME INVOLVING THOUSANDS OF IT WORKERS\n\nNorth Korea has maintained that it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles in the face of what it perceives as U.S.-led military threats. Kim has described spy satellites as crucial for monitoring U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhancing the threat posed by his nuclear-capable missiles.\n\n\"Given the fact that the security environment for our state is undergoing drastic changes owing to U.S. military maneuvers and provocations of all sorts, possessing military reconnaissance satellites presents itself as a prerequisite for our state to bolster up its self-defensive deterrent and safeguard its sovereignty and security from potential threats,\" Kim said.\n\n\"Although we failed to achieve the results we had hoped to get in the recent reconnaissance satellite launch, we must never feel scared or dispirited but make still greater efforts. It is natural that one learns more and makes greater progress after experiencing failure.\"\n\nNorth Korea hasn’t commented on when it would be ready to attempt a satellite launch again, which some experts say could take months.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKim has been boosting the visibility of his ties with Russia in recent months, highlighted by a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in September as they align in the face of their separate confrontations with Washington.\n\nKim’s meeting with Putin was held at a spaceport in the Russian Far East and came after North Korea’s consecutive failures in its attempts to launch its first spy satellite.

            "summary": "Palestinian health officials said Israeli strikes killed 11 people overnight into Monday, including a woman and three children, in central Gaza.\n\nA strike on a home in the built-up Bureij refugee camp late Sunday killed four people, including the three children. The second strike, early Monday, killed seven people, including a woman, in the Nuseirat refugee camp.\n\nEarlier Monday, the Israeli military said that the body of a man presumed to be a hostage was found in a community near the Gaza border that Hamas militants attacked on Oct. 7.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden said Friday that Israel has offered Hamas a three-phase cease-fire and hostage release deal, declaring it was time to end the fighting in Gaza and that Hamas is “no longer capable” of carrying out another large-scale attack on Israel.\n\nIsrael is expanding its offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, once the main hub of humanitarian aid operations. The Israeli invasion has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and other supplies to Palestinians facing widespread hunger. Israel faces growing international criticism over the huge cost in civilian lives and the widespread destruction caused by its nearly 8-month war with Hamas.\n\nIsraeli bombardments and ground operations in the besieged territory have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducted about 250. Israel says around 100 hostages are still captive in Gaza, along with the bodies of around 30 more.\n\nCurrently:\n\n— Israeli leader Netanyahu faces growing pressure at home after Biden’s Gaza proposal\n\n— Israel seeks a ‘ governing alternative ’ to Hamas in Gaza.

The second strike, early Monday, killed seven people, including a woman, in the Nuseirat refugee camp.\n\nBoth camps date back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven out of areas that became part of the new state. The refugees and their descendants make up most of Gaza’s population.\n\nAn Associated Press reporter counted the bodies as they arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah on Monday and confirmed the details with hospital records.\n\nIsrael says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames Hamas for their deaths because the militant group places fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in dense, residential areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children.\n\nIRAN’S TOP LEADER SAYS ISRAEL IS ‘MELTING DOWN’\n\nIran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei Monday said Israel is melting down due to its war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nSpeaking in a ceremony marking 35th anniversary of late leader of the county Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Khamenei said “Today, the Zionist regime gradually melts down before eyes of the world’s people.” State television broadcast his speech live.\n\nIn a nearly 55-minute speech, the leader said that Israel’s response to the Oct. 7th attack by Hamas that began the war placed it in a “dead-end corridor.”\n\nKhamenei also said that the war had derailed Israel’s U.S.-backed efforts to reach accomodations with regional neighbors, which he characterized as part of an Israeli plot to dominate the region.\n\nISRAELI MILITARY REPORTS SHOOTING DOWN MISSILE OVER RED SEA\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military says it shot down a surface-to-surface missile fired toward southern Israel from the Red Sea.\n\nThere were no reports of casualties or damage in Monday’s incident, which set off air raid sirens in the southernmost Israeli city of Eilat.\n\nThe military did not specify the missile’s origin, but it was likely fired by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who have claimed several drone and missile strikes on Israel in recent months. Nearly all the projectiles have been intercepted.\n\nThe Iran-backed Houthis have also repeatedly attacked international shipping in the Red Sea, portraying their actions as a blockade of Israel in support of the Palestinians. But most of the ships that have been targeted have no known ties to Israel.\n\nISRAEL FINDS BODY OF MAN THOUGHT TO BE HOSTAGE\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military says the body of a presumed hostage was found in a community near the Gaza border that Hamas militants had attacked on Oct. 7.\n\nDolev Yehud, 35, was thought to be among scores of hostages held in Gaza until Monday, when the military announced the discovery of his body and said he had been killed in the initial attack.\n\nHis remains were found at Kibbutz Nir Oz, where he lived and worked as a paramedic. Dolev’s wife, Sigal, who was nine months pregnant on Oct. 7, gave birth to their fourth child nine days after the attack, according to Israeli media.\n\nMedical professionals and scientists, including archaeologists, have spent months trying to identify remains found in communities attacked by Palestinian militants in the wide-ranging assault that ignited the war in Gaza.\n\nThe surprise attack into Israel killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. The militants abducted around 250 people, more than 100 of whom were released during a cease-fire last year.\n\nThe Israeli government says militants in Gaza are still holding around 85 hostages and the remains of 39 others.\n\nIsrael launched a massive offensive in response to the attack that has killed over 36,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their count.",

During her three-year tenure, The Post saw much of its audience dissipate.\n\nWhile The Post celebrated several journalism triumphs under Buzbee, winning numerous awards, her tenure was also stained by severe infighting in 2022 that spurred national headlines and embarrassed the newspaper.\n\nThe Post said that Matt Murray, former editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal, will immediately replace Buzbee as executive editor. Murray will serve in that position through the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAfter the November election, Robert Winnett, deputy editor of The Telegraph Media Group, will take on a new role as editor of The Post, overseeing its core news offering. Murray will then transition to overseeing the formation of a new newsroom at The Post, one which focuses on service and social media journalism.\n\nLewis said the creation of an additional newsroom division represents a “definitive step away from the ‘one size fits all’ approach and moving towards meeting our audiences where they are.”\n\nThe changes to leadership come as Lewis moves quickly to turn around The Post, which soared with audience growth during the chaotic Donald Trump presidency but has since struggled to find its footing.\n\nLewis, who unveiled the main contours of his revival plan last month, disclosed to staffers that the newspaper lost $77 million last year and 50% of its audience since 2020.\n\n“To speak candidly,” Lewis told staffers during a 90-minute meeting, “we are in a hole, and we have been for some time.”\n\nLike Lewis, Murray previously spent much of his career inside Rupert Murdoch’s media empire. Murray worked at The Wall Street Journal for 29 years, stepping down from the top role at the business broadsheet last year.\n\n“I’m deeply honored to join such a storied news institution with its long, rich history of memorable and impactful journalism and want to thank Sally for her great leadership,” Murray said in the statement. “I am excited by Will and Jeff’s vision for The Post’s next era of growth and reinvention and can’t wait to get started.”\n\nThis story had been updated with new information.",

(AP Photo/Chuck Zoeller, File)(AP/Chuck Zoeller) NEW YORK (AP) — The Washington Post said Sunday that its executive editor, Sally Buzbee, has stepped down after three years at the top of one of journalism’s most storied brands.\n\nShe will be replaced by Matt Murray, former editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal, through this fall’s presidential election. Following that, Robert Winnett, deputy editor of the Telegraph Media Group, will take over as editor as the newsroom restructures its operations.\n\nNo reason was given for Buzbee’s departure. She wasn’t quoted in the news release announcing that she was leaving, and did not immediately return a message seeking comment.\n\nThe Post also announced that it was launching a new division in its newsroom dedicated to reaching audiences who want to pay for and consume news in a different way.\n\nBuzbee, former top editor at The Associated Press, was selected as the Post’s top editor in May 2021. She replaced a renowned predecessor, Martin Baron, after the Post exploded in popularity during the Trump administration.\n\nBuzbee was the first woman to serve as executive editor of The Washington Post. And like Jill Abramson, the first woman to be top editor at The New York Times, her tenure was short: Abramson had her job from 2011 to 2014.\n\nIt has been a miserable few years financially for the news industry, including for the Post. It has bled subscribers to the point where new publisher, Will Lewis, told employees last month that the newspaper lost $77 million last year.\n\n“To speak candidly, we are in a hole, and have been for some time,” Lewis said, according to the Post.\n\nLewis was named late last year to replace Fred Ryan as Post publisher. He has worked at both The Wall Street Journal and The Telegraph in England, the places he turned to to find the new executives.\n\nHe’s talked about creating a multi-tier subscription plan for The Post, similar to that in place at Politico. In an email to employees late Sunday, Lewis said the new department will focus on more video storytelling, will embrace artificial intelligence and flexible payment methods. It will begin this fall, he said.\n\nIn an earlier meeting, “we highlighted the need to move away from the traditional one-size-fits-all approach in the news media industry and focus on creating news for a broader range of readers and customers.”\n\nIt augurs a change to the traditional structure of the Post. In his memo, Lewis mentioned “three newsrooms.” Winnett will not take on the title of executive editor, but he will be responsible for the “core coverage areas” of politics, investigations, business, technology, sports and features. He has run The Telegraph’s news operations since 2013, the Post said.\n\nMurray will take over as leader of the newly-created department starting Nov. 6, the Post said. No one will have the title of executive editor: Murray, Winnett and David Shipley, the editorial page editor who will lead the “opinions newsroom,” will each report directly to Lewis, the Post said.\n\n“By creating three strong journalism functions — core, service/social and opinions — we are taking a definitive step away from the ‘one size fits all’ approach and moving towards meeting our audiences where they are,” Lewis said.\n\nThe Post won three Pulitzer Prizes last month, including one in national reporting for a vivid series on the impact of the AR-15 rifle.\n\n___\n\nDavid Bauder writes about media for The Associated Press.

We are grateful for the relationships we have created through this horrible time and the support and love we were able to give each other. We also want to thank my Aunt Vicki who was sitting in court almost every day of this trial for those of us who weren’t able to do so. That took great strength to do.\n\nWe can all start to heal from the terrible losses we have suffered. We will miss Tammy every single day of our lives but we have some comfort knowing we will see her again.\n\nIf you have been touched by Tammy and would like to support her foundation, The Tammy Douglas Daybell foundation, to put books into the hands of children and increase literacy, please consider donating to The Tammy Douglas Daybell foundation. Thank you.\n\nBrandon Boudreaux’s family\n\nOne year ago we sat as the first person was held accountable for what will be a never ending void in the lives of so many families. We once again have someone being held responsible. For the many people who have spent so many years working on or in this case in Idaho, we thank you. To the jurors who will carry the weight of these events with them for the rest of life, we thank you for taking on this burden.\n\nSo many families can be hurt from a tragedy. Often times, many suffer unseen to the public view. We mourn with you. Words seem feebile at times like this to express ourselves. A hole will exist in our lives that will never be filled, no result from any trial will fill it, but justice has a right to be served and we are grateful for those who uphold it. We encourage any and all who participated in crimes to be held accountable.\n\nNo one can replace JJ, Tylee, Tammy, or Charles. This world suffers with out them. They will be forever missed and mourned by those who wish for more time with them. As we heard from some who loved them, we felt of this pain because of who they were.\n\nTo those suffering, we offer our empathy and love. As we have suffered these years and dealt with our anger, grief, and pain, we have found strength and relief in our faith.\n\nMatthew 11:28-30\n\n28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\n\n29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\n\nWe offer the invitation given thousand of years ago to turn your hearts to him who saves. Study his words and forgive. It has not filled the hole left – no verdict or process can. But it has brought peace in the quiet of life’s storm, and healing to the scars of life’s most unfair moments.\n\nMatt and Heather Daybell\n\nThe last few days and months have been a rollercoaster of emotions for so many, including for Heather and I.\n\nThe justice we’ve sought for has finally been attained, but for us in this moment, our feelings go back and forth from happiness and relief to sadness and sorrow. The jury’s unanimous verdict and sentence brings to a close nearly 10 years since this all began for our little family.\n\nWe would sincerely like to thank SO MANY who have reached out and offered words of support and love these last 2 months, and throughout the past 4 ½ years. Your kindness, especially towards Heather, has been needed and truly appreciated.\n\nLike so many of you, we hope to continue to heal our family, move forward together, and look toward better days ahead.\n\nWe are so grateful to the jury, to Judge Boyce, to all law enforcement involved, and to the Fremont and Madison prosecution teams. A sincere thank you for your tireless efforts, expertise, and preparation for such a complex and emotional case – we know it has affected each of you and your families. Thank you.\n\nWe continue to express our love and support to Kay and Larry Woodcock and their extended families, to Tammy’s father Ron and the entire Douglas family, and to Colby and the extended Cox families. Kay and Larry reached out from the very beginning and have been such great examples to us.\n\nWe also express our love to the many other countless victims that have been affected, including those within our own family.\n\nWe realize that nothing will bring Tammy, JJ, and Tylee back, but we sincerely hope and pray that, with justice now served, we are all able to move forward together, hoping for brighter days ahead, and showing greater love and compassion to all.\n\nMatt and Heather Daybell\n\nCox and Shiflet families\n\nWe want to express our heartfelt gratitude for all who worked so hard to achieve this true and just verdict and sentence.\n\nFirst, law enforcement who, together with the prosecution office, were vigilant and unstoppable in the pursuit of justice for Tylee, Tammy and JJ.\n\nThe witnesses who had to give testimony, sometimes at great emotional expense.\n\nThe courageous jurors, who had to face the most horrific evidence that will surely have a lifelong impact on them.\n\nThe court, especially Judge Boyce, for the serious, measured decisions that protected the defendant’s rights and the victim’s silent cries for justice. It was so gratifying to see our justice system work!\n\nWe are grateful for all, seen and unseen, who contributed to this huge endeavor. We believe this is a fair sentence in light of the cruel, and callous manner in which our loved ones were lost.

            "title": "Idaho death penalty: What to know about Chad Daybell’s sentencing",
            "summary": "CNN —\n\nChad Daybell was sentenced to death for the murders of his wife and two of his second wife’s children this weekend, but when and whether he will be executed remain wide-open questions.\n\nIt’s typical for the appeals process in capital cases to go on for years, and they often reach the US Supreme Court before an inmate is ultimately put to death. In Idaho, the imposition of a death sentence is followed by a mandatory post-conviction review, and defendants are able to pursue an appeal after the filing of a death warrant.\n\nIn the meantime, the high-profile nature of Daybell’s case – and the looming capital trial of Bryan Kohberger, who’s pleaded not guilty in the killings of four University of Idaho college students – will bring renewed attention to Idaho’s death penalty, which is seldom used and attracted headlines earlier this year when officials halted their first execution attempt in more than a decade.\n\nHere’s what to know about the death penalty in Idaho.\n\nExecutions are uncommon\n\nExecutions are relatively rare in Idaho, which, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, has carried out just three executions since 1976, when the US Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment. The first was in 1994, followed by two others in 2011 and 2012.\n\nTo put this in context, Texas has put to death 580 inmates within the timeframe, DPIC’s data show – by far the most of any state. And Oklahoma, which has carried out the highest number of executions per capita, has executed 124.\n\nOnly a handful of the 27 states where the death penalty remains legal have carried out as few executions as Idaho: Kentucky, Montana and Pennsylvania have also each put to death three people since 1976. Kansas, Wyoming and Oregon have executed even fewer, with zero, one and two executions, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, Idaho’s death row housed just eight inmates prior to Daybell’s sentence, according to the Idaho Department of Corrections. California – which, it should be noted, has a population more than 21 times the size of Idaho – has 638 condemned inmates, nearly 80 times the size of Idaho’s death row.\n\nOfficials recently halted an execution\n\nIdaho officials attempted to carry out the state’s first execution in 12 years several months ago. But they were forced to abort midway through the procedure, citing difficulties setting an intravenous line to deliver the fatal drugs for lethal injection.\n\nThat echoed difficulties seen in executions in other states, including Alabama. Officials there similarly had to call off two executions in 2022 after authorities were unable to access the inmates’ veins before their death warrants expired.\n\nThe execution of Thomas Creech, scheduled in Idaho for February 28, was “unable to proceed” after eight failed attempts to establish IV access, state Department of Correction Director Josh Tewalt said at the time. The execution team encountered two different issues, Tewalt said at a news conference: In some instances it was “an access issue,” and in others a “vein quality issue.”\n\nTewalt praised the medical team’s willingness to halt the execution, telling reporters the state’s “first objective is to carry this out with dignity, professionalism and respect,” and he disputed the suggestion the execution was a “failure.” The department said in a statement Creech’s warrant would expire while the state considered next steps.\n\nThe Idaho State prison complex near Kuna is shown on February 28, the day officials halted the execution of Thomas Creech after they failed to find a vein to establish an IV line to carry out the lethal injection. Kyle Green/AP\n\n2 execution methods, both with challenges\n\nThe decision to call off Creech’s execution also raised questions about when and how the state would endeavor to put an inmate to death in the future.\n\nTewalt told reporters a second attempt using lethal injection – Idaho’s main method of execution – would require the state to seek out new chemicals.\n\nWhile he expressed “a high level of confidence” the state could secure the drugs, a number of states have struggled in recent years to obtain them after pharmaceutical companies began prohibiting the use of their products for that purpose. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, for example, has repeatedly postponed executions citing companies’ unwillingness to sell the drugs necessary.\n\nIdaho recently legalized a second method of execution, with an aim toward sidestepping this kind of supply problem. Last year, Gov. Brad Little signed a new law allowing the department of corrections to use the firing squad if the drugs are not available.\n\nBut as of late February, the state lacked the facilities it needed to carry out an execution by firing squad, Tewalt said. In a message to corrections staff, the director said his department had been working to retrofit its execution chamber to accommodate the alternative method.\n\n“Those initial efforts were unsuccessful because contractors who would engage in this type of work have expressed their unwillingness to work on a project related to executions,” Tewalt said, “but efforts are ongoing.”\n\nThe director added construction on the execution chamber would prevent the state from being able to use it – even for lethal injection – until the work is completed.",

            "summary": "He was accused of murdering his first wife and second wife's two children.\n\nA jury has found Chad Daybell guilty in the murders of his first wife and his second wife's two children in what prosecutors in Idaho said was a plot to pursue \"money, power and sex.\"\n\nThe verdict in the capital murder trial followed seven weeks of testimony and comes more than a year after Daybell's second wife, Lori Vallow, was also convicted of murdering her two youngest children -- Joshua \"J.J.\" Vallow, 7, and Tylee Ryan, 16 -- in a so-called doomsday plot.\n\nThe jury began deliberations Wednesday evening, during which they were sequestered, before reaching a verdict midday Thursday finding him guilty on all counts.\n\nProsecutors have said they plan to pursue the death penalty for the murder charges. The sentencing phase of the trial is set to begin Thursday afternoon.\n\nProsecutors claimed that Vallow and Daybell thought the two children were \"dark spirits\" and \"zombies\" and conspired with Vallow's now-deceased brother, Alex Cox, to murder them in 2019, approximately a year after the couple met at a religious conference.\n\nDaybell, 55, was also charged with murder and conspiracy in the death of his former wife, Tamara \"Tammy\" Daybell, 49, who died Oct. 19, 2019. Her cause of death was asphyxiation, prosecutors revealed during Vallow's trial.\n\nChad Daybell sits at the defense table after the jury's verdict in his murder trial was read at the Ada County Courthouse in Boise, Idaho, on May 30, 2024. Kyle Green/AP\n\nProsecutors said Daybell, the author of books about the apocalypse, promoted spiritual beliefs to justify the three murders and had claimed that all three were possessed and \"marked\" them for death.\n\n\"Three dead bodies ... and for what? Money, power and sex. That's what the defendant cared about,\" prosecutor Lindsey Blake told jurors during closing arguments on Wednesday.\n\nProsecutors said Daybell's communications showed he never intended to divorce Tamara Daybell, whom he had been married to for nearly 30 years and had five children with before carrying on an affair with Vallow.\n\nVallow and Daybell married in Hawaii 17 days after Tamara Daybell was found dead in her bed, prosecutors said. At the time, Vallow's previous husband, Charles Vallow, was also dead -- fatally shot by Cox -- and her two youngest children had not yet been reported missing, they said. Ryan was a child from Vallow's third marriage while J.J. was Charles Vallow's nephew, whom they adopted.\n\n\"Chad said the plan was for he and Lori to be together unencumbered by earthly relatives, earthly obstacles,\" Blake said.\n\nLori Vallow Daybell stands and listens as the jury's verdict is read at the Ada County Courthouse in Boise, Idaho, May 12, 2023. Kyle Green/AP\n\nThe children's remains were found on an Idaho property belonging to Daybell in June 2020 following a monthslong search after extended family members reported them missing, prosecutors said. Ryan's DNA was found on a pickaxe and shovel that were in Daybell's garage, Blake said.\n\nDuring closing statements, defense attorney John Prior told jurors that prosecutors showed only a \"handful\" of text messages that talked about \"light and dark\" and \"death percentages\" out of thousands between Daybell and Vallow to try and insinuate that there was a murder plot.\n\n\"At no time did the prosecuting attorney show you a text message that said, 'Let's kill the kids, let's kill Tammy,'\" he said.\n\nPrior further argued that prosecutors failed to provide proof that there was any agreement to commit a crime or any evidence tying Daybell to the deaths.\n\nDuring the trial, Prior's witnesses included a forensic pathologist who believed Tamara Daybell's cause of death should have been classified as \"undetermined\" and one of Daybell's children, who told jurors that his mother had been sick before she died.\n\nA picture of Tylee Ryan and J.J. Vallow is seen on a fence opposite the property where their bodies were found in 2020, on April 4, 2023 in Rexburg, Idaho. Natalie Behring/Getty Images\n\nDaybell was also found guilty of two counts of insurance fraud related to life insurance policies he had on Tamara Daybell for which he was the beneficiary, prosecutors said.\n\nDaybell did not take the stand during the trial. He pleaded not guilty to his charges.\n\nHis case is being presided over by the same judge from Vallow's trial, Judge Steve Boyce.\n\nBoyce sentenced Vallow to life in prison without parole after the jury in her trial found her guilty of all charges. The judge had granted the defense's motion to dismiss the death penalty in her case before her trial began.\n\nVallow has also been accused of conspiring to kill her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, who was fatally shot by Cox in 2019 during a confrontation at her Arizona home. Police were investigating claims that Cox shot his brother-in-law in self-defense when Cox died from natural causes months after the fatal shooting.\n\nShe was indicted on one count of first-degree murder by a Maricopa County grand jury in 2021 in connection with the fatal shooting.\n\nShe was also charged with first-degree premeditated murder for allegedly plotting to kill the ex-husband of her niece.\n\nShe pleaded not guilty to both charges last year. Her trial is scheduled to begin in August.",

The couple, who shared extreme apocalyptic, cult-like religious views, murdered two of Vallow's children, 7-year-old J.J. Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan, as well as Daybell's first wife, Tammy Daybell, in 2019. Vallow was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Daybell may face a firing squad under Idaho law.\n\nCHAD DAYBELL SENTENCED TO DEATH IN IDAHO FOR MURDER OF LORI VALLOW'S 2 CHILDREN, FIRST WIFE\n\nSummer Shiflet pictured with her sister Lori Vallow, now a convicted murderer.\n\n\"They did not deserve what happened to them,\" Shiftlet said of her niece and nephew.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut prosecutors have argued in both Vallow's and Daybell's cases that the desire for \"money, power and sex\" is what drove the duo to kill Vallow's two children and Daybell's first wife. Vallow and Daybell also stole J.J. and Tylee's Social Security benefits between Oct. 1, 2019, when they disappeared, and Jan. 22, 2020, after they were murdered.\n\nCHAD DAYBELL VERDICT: JURY FINDS DOOMSDAY AUTHOR GUILTY OF MURDERING LORI VALLOW'S KIDS, FIRST WIFE\n\nThe two children were found dead in shallow graves on Chad Daybell's Rexburg, Idaho, property in June 2020, months after they disappeared from their home in September 2019. The 16-year-old's remains were burned while the 7-year-old was bound in duct tape.\n\nThe Ada County coroner testified that J.J. died of asphyxiation by a plastic bag and Tylee died of homicide by unknown means due to the fact that her remains were dismembered and badly burned before they were buried.\n\nLORI VALLOW TRIAL: ‘CULT MOM’ SENTENCED IN MURDERS OF 2 OF HER CHILDREN, HUSBAND'S FIRST WIFE\n\nLori and Chad Daybell are accused of killing 17-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old J.J. Vallow in 2019.\n\nAfter their children disappeared, Vallow and Daybell ran off to Hawaii to get married. Authorities arrested Vallow in February 2020 and Daybell in June 2020.\n\nLISTEN TO LORI VALLOW'S JAIL CALL WITH HER SISTER:\n\nAt Vallow's sentencing, Judge Steven Boyce told the so-called \"cult mom\" that she has \"mental health issues,\" including diagnoses such as \"delusional disorder\" mixed with \"hyper-religiosity\" and a \"continuous and unspecified personality disorder\" with narcissistic features.\n\nLORI VALLOW TRIAL: IDAHO CORONER REVEALS JJ VALLOW AND TYLEE RYAN'S CAUSE OF DEATH\n\nShiflet said Saturday that she believes her sister is still under the delusion that her children are somehow not missing and in a better place.\n\n\"One thing for me, personally, in coming to understand why this happened, which is a huge question, is: how does your sister and this mother … get to this point from a one-year period from meeting Chad Daybell to having your kids murdered,\" Shiflet said during the CrimeCon panel. \"How does that happen? How do you get to that point? So, for me, it's been helpful to understand her diagnosis and to understand that … her reality is as real to her as our reality is to us. And she 100% thinks she is sane. She does not think there is anything wrong with her.\"\n\nShe added that Vallow would rather be in prison than hospitalized for her mental health disorders.\n\n\"She doesn't think she's done anything wrong,\" Shiflet said.\n\nHAWAII POLICE SERVE SUBPOENA TO BIKINI-CLAD LORI VALLOW RELAXING POOLSIDE: VIDEO\n\nSummer Shiflet said she believes her sister, Lori Vallow, still believes she did nothing wrong even after her conviction in her children's murders.\n\nShiflet also addressed comments she made in 2020 after her sister's arrest when she and her mother went on national television to defend Vallow. She acknowledged that she was wrong at the time because she simply did not believe her sister to be capable of murdering her own children.\n\nShiflet described her sister as a loving mother and sister prior to her relationship with Daybell and her delusions. She also mentioned that she and Vallow have experienced a lot of death in their family, and she believes something eventually cracked in Vallow, leading her to believe the deaths were occurring for a specific reason.\n\nDuring her sentencing in August 2023, Vallow told the courtroom that her deceased children were \"happy\" and \"busy.\"\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"I have had many communications with Jesus Christ, savior of this world, and our heavenly parents. I have had many angelic visitors have come and communicated with me and even manifested themselves to me because of these communications,\" Vallow said at the time. \"I know for a fact that my children are happy and busy in the spirit world. Because of my communications with my friend, Tammy Daybell, I know that she is also very happy and extremely busy.\"\n\nSIGN UP TO GET TRUE CRIME NEWSLETTER\n\nShe added that she has \"always mourned the loss\" of her \"loved ones\" and has \"lost many in this mortal world\" with whom she believes she is still in communication in the spirit world.\n\nSummer Shiflet said her sister, Lori Vallow, would rather be in prison than a hospital for her mental health disorders.\n\nDaybell has written several apocalyptic novels based loosely on Mormon theology. Both he and Vallow were involved in a group that promotes preparedness for the biblical end of times.\n\nOfficials extradited Vallow to Arizona in November 2023 in a separate case, where she faces one first-degree murder charge and one premeditated first-degree murder charge in Maricopa County.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal article source: Lori Vallow's sister reacts to Chad Daybell's death sentence: 'Everything I needed to hear'",

The situation came to light very suddenly. Despite swift action, we were unable to bridge the necessary gaps,\" read the letter.\n\nEv Dowling, who would be a senior, says he, along with other students, faculty, and staff, are shocked to learn the news.\n\n\"I feel like I'm at the end of that stretch. Three years in, I was making plans for after graduation and now I need to make plans to graduate from somewhere else,\" said Dowling.\n\nThe university's website states there were about 1,300 students and 77 full-time faculty members in 2022.\n\n\"The staff and faculty have worked so hard. They really have given us all the best opportunities, and knowing that they're out of jobs while I'm out of school, it's the worst news ever,\" added Dowling.\n\nUpcoming summer courses will be canceled and the university will not enroll a new class in the fall.\n\nStudents told Action News that they feel the abrupt closure is overwhelming.\n\n\"They just put up these new banners, literally like a month ago. Why?\" questioned Kaylee Morris, a student at UArts.\n\nShe says she was blindsided by Friday's announcement.\n\n\"I had an internship lined up over the summer, I was going into my senior year, I was about to start working on my senior thesis, and I'm just shocked this is happening. There really weren't any signs,\" Morris said.\n\nStaff were just as shocked as the students when receiving the news.\n\n\"I'm an alum and a staff member, so it sucks to lose my job. It also sucks to lose a magical community. One of the few art institutions left in the country,\" said a staff member who did not want to be identified.\n\nHe told Action News that he learned hours before the loss of the accreditation by the staff union group, but he wasn't led to believe the school would close.\n\n\"We had a huge recruitment push for fall of this year,\" he said.\n\nThe university says it will be helping current students by developing \"seamless transfer pathways\" to other Philadelphia schools, including Temple University, Drexel University, and Moore College of Art and Design.\n\nFor some students, however, this plan seems complicated.\n\n\"I'm a theater student. I can go to Temple's musical theater program but my roommate, she's an illustration major, and Temple and Drexel don't have her majors,\" noted UArts student Fern Morehouse.\n\n\"My major is film and animation, that doesn't really exist at other schools. That was part of the reason why I liked this school,\" added Morris.\n\nOn June 3, there will be a town hall for students, faculty, and staff. The university says it will send times and details over the weekend.\n\n\"I'm saddened by the news of University of the Arts' imminent plans to close,\" said Mayor Cherelle L.

Our City cares deeply about the future of every person who studies or works there,\" Parker continued.\n\nYou can read the full letter below from President Kerry Walk and Chair of the Board of Trustees Judson Aaron:\n\n\"Today is a heartbreaking day.\n\nUniversity of the Arts will close as of Friday June 7, 2024. We would have shared this news with you directly, but the Middle States Commission on Higher Education elected to withdraw UArts' accreditation and announce before we could communicate with you. We know that this makes hearing the news of UArts' abrupt closure even worse.\n\nThe closure means that we will be canceling our summer courses, we will not enroll a new class in the fall, and we will support our continuing students in their progress to degree by developing seamless transfer pathways to our partners: Temple University,\n\nDrexel University, and Moore College of Art and Design, among others.\n\nWe know that the news of UArts' closure comes as a shock. Like you, we are struggling to make sense of the present moment. But like many institutions of higher learning, UArts has been in a fragile financial state, with many years of declining enrollments, declining revenues, and increasing expenses. We have worked hard this year alongside many of you to take steps that would secure the University's sustainability. The progress we made together has been impressive.\n\nUnfortunately, however, we could not overcome the ultimate challenge we faced: with a cash position that has steadily weakened, we could not cover significant, unanticipated expenses. The situation came to light very suddenly.

We are committed to providing a space for your questions and concerns.\n\nWe have done everything in our power to address this crisis and avoid the worst possible outcome: an abrupt closure. Yet we have reached this deeply painful outcome, which we know affects our entire community.\n\nWe are grateful for all you're doing to support one another during this most difficult time.\"",

When I was reading it I couldn’t even process what was going on,\" former student Aaron Foreman said.\n\nThe Middle States Commission on Higher Education said it is withdrawing the university's accreditation. The withdrawal goes into effect this Saturday.\n\nUArts said that it will not be enrolling a new class in the fall. In a statement, the university explained that it will work with current students to transfer to partnering schools like Temple University, Drexel University and others.\n\nGet Philly local news, weather forecasts, sports and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia newsletters.\n\nSchools that lose their accreditation have the right to appeal the action, but the commission says that earlier this week it was notified by UArts that the school is anticipating to close on Saturday.\n\nThe commission says that it requested what it calls a \"supplemental information report\" that was due on Wednesday at noon. It also requested a teach-out plan by June 7, 2024, that would give students a fair chance to finish their education.\n\nUArts lost its accreditation because of what was submitted in the supplemental information report, according to MSCHE.\n\n“University of the Arts is deeply saddened to announce it will be closing as of Friday, June 7, 2024. The closure means that the University will not enroll a new class in the fall and will support our continuing students in their progress to degree by developing seamless transfer pathways to our partners: Temple University, Drexel University, and Moore College of Art and Design, among others. Like many institutions of higher learning, UArts has been in a fragile financial state, with many years of declining enrollments, declining revenues, and increasing expenses. As operations wind down, the University will make every effort to support our students, faculty, and staff,\" the University of the Arts said in a statement shared with NBC10.\n\nThe university said that declining enrollment and revenues are what is forcing the school to close its doors because of increasing expenses, according to the statement shared by UArts.\n\n“I am profoundly disappointed and frustrated by the University of the Arts loss of accreditation and upcoming closure. This esteemed arts school has been a cornerstone of creativity and culture in Center City Philadelphia for generations. Its loss is a significant setback and not only a devastating blow to our local community but also a significant setback for the arts and education in our city at large,\" Pennsylvania State Representative Ben Waxman said in a statement.\n\nOfficials with the university say they will be hosting town hall meetings for the school community. Information about these town halls will be shared over the weekend.\n\n\"We have done everything in our power to address this crisis and avoid the worst possible outcome: an abrupt closure. Yet we have reached this deeply painful outcome, which we know affects our entire community. We are grateful for all you’re doing to support one another during this most difficult time,\" the school's chair of the board of trustees, Judson Aaron and the school's president Kerry Walk said in a statement.\n\nThe university is one of the oldest schools in the country dating back to the 1870s. It's an institution that has been a fixture in Philadelphia producing artists and musicians from around the world.\n\n\"I’ve learned so much from my time there. I feel sad that it’s coming to a close for all these students now,\" Foreman told NBC10.\n\nIf you're a student and have any questions about the university losing its accreditation, click here.\n\nThis is a developing story.

            "summary": "“I think the uncomfortable thing is really, that there was no plan,” she added. “A responsible institution doesn’t do this a week before they shut down.”\n\nRoberts said they “went broke” in order to be able to attend the university, and wants answers on how student loan debt will be handled. As of Saturday, they hadn’t yet received details on a town hall the university said it will hold for students and faculty on Monday — but Roberts plans to be there.\n\n“UArts’ whole brand to their students, it’s like ‘Building community through art.’ And in the last 24 hours, they said that doesn’t matter with their actions,” Roberts said.\n\nThe closure was first made public when the Middle States Commission on Higher Education announced the immediate withdrawal of accreditation effective Saturday. UArts notified the commission on Wednesday about the school’s impending closure. The commission said UArts failed to provide adequate plans for closure.\n\nThe UArts teachers union told WHYY News Friday night that they had not been notified of the closure prior to the commission’s announcement.\n\nThe university said the reason for the sudden closure was due to financial issues:\n\n“We know that the news of UArts’ closure comes as a shock. Like you, we are struggling to make sense of the present moment. But like many institutions of higher learning, UArts has been in a fragile financial state, with many years of declining enrollments, declining revenues, and increasing expenses. We have worked hard this year alongside many of you to take steps that would secure the University’s sustainability. The progress we made together has been impressive.\n\n“Unfortunately, however, we could not overcome the ultimate challenge we faced: with a cash position that has steadily weakened, we could not cover significant, unanticipated expenses. The situation came to light very suddenly. Despite swift action, we were unable to bridge the necessary gaps.”\n\nJennifer Cressman had committed to attend University of the Arts in the fall to study photography and paid the $300 deposit. The recent Bucks County Community College graduate said as of Saturday morning she still had not received any direct communication from the university about the pending closure.\n\n“I’m a little frustrated, because now I have to figure something out for school,” she said. “I don’t know what I’m going to do now because all of the applications for other colleges have closed by now.”\n\nCressman said “sooner would have been better” to know about the closure. She was in contact with her adviser recently about her classes and the closure announcement came “right out of the blue.”\n\n“There’s not a lot of art schools in Philly so it’s sad seeing them close,” Cressman said.\n\nUniversity of the Arts now joins Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts as another higher education arts institution that has shuttered its degree programs. PAFA announced in January it was cutting its degree programs at the conclusion of the 2024-2025 academic year due to declining enrollment and increasing costs. The Delaware College of Art and Design, in Wilmington, Del., also announced in May it was closing this year, and would not be open for the 2024-2025 academic year.\n\n“It just feels like one more nail in the coffin in Philadelphia,” Fried, the UArts professor, said, noting that the university was supposed to absorb some of the PAFA students who are going to be left without a program next year.\n\nConrad Benner, a Philly-based arts curator and founder of StreetsDept.com, started a discussion on X, asking people to talk about whether or not they stayed in Philadelphia because of University of the Arts or PAFA programs.",

            "title": "Fact check: Trump falsely claims he didn’t call to lock up Hillary Clinton",
            "summary": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump falsely claimed in a new interview that he didn’t make a “lock her up” call for the imprisonment of his Democratic opponent of the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump, who faces the possibility of a prison sentence after he was convicted last week on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, was asked in an interview aired Sunday on Fox News about how he had “famously said… ‘lock her up’” in relation to Clinton but did not jail her when he was president.\n\nDuring his answer, Trump said he had decided that imprisoning Clinton “would have been a terrible thing.” Then he added: “I didn’t say ‘lock her up,’ but the people would all say ‘lock her up, lock her up.’”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim that “I didn’t say ‘lock her up’” is false. He called for Clinton’s imprisonment on multiple occasions, including by using the phrase “lock her up.”\n\nTrump often used such rhetoric while criticizing Clinton’s email practices as secretary of state during the Obama administration, which prompted a federal investigation. She was never charged with a crime.\n\nDuring campaign rallies in 2016, Trump sometimes paused his remarks as his supporters engaged in chants of “lock her up,” giving the chants time to continue. On other occasions, he explicitly repeated those words himself.\n\n“For what she’s done, they should lock her up,” Trump said after the crowd chanted “lock her up” at an October 2016 rally in North Carolina.\n\n“‘Lock her up’ is right,” he said at an October 2016 rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump also explicitly called for Clinton’s imprisonment using different phrasing.\n\n“Hillary Clinton has to go to jail, OK? She has to go to jail,” he said in a June 2016 speech in California. “She has to go to jail,” he repeated in an October 2016 speech in Florida. And at a presidential debate in October 2016, after Clinton said, “It’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,” Trump responded, “Because you’d be in jail.”\n\nTrump softened his rhetoric shortly after he defeated Clinton in the election, saying he didn’t want to hurt her and didn’t feel strongly about prosecuting her. In his 2020 campaign for reelection, though, he again made calls to “lock her up.”\n\n“You should lock her up, I’ll tell you,” he said at a January 2020 rally in Ohio. At an October 2020 rally in Georgia, after the crowd chanted “lock them up” in relation to the Biden family, Trump said, “You should lock them up. Lock up the Bidens. Lock up Hillary.”",

            "summary": "Former President Trump said Sunday that he never called for former election rival Hillary Clinton to be sent to jail, despite making the demand during his 2016 campaign.\n\nTrump, who himself could face jail time after being found guilty of 34 felony counts on Thursday, brushed off a recounting of his campaign trail attacks against Clinton during a “Fox & Friends” interview.\n\n“You famously said, regarding Hillary Clinton, ‘Lock her up.’ You declined to do that as president,” Fox News’s Will Cain said to the former president.\n\n“I beat her,” Trump replied. “It’s easier when you win. And they always said ‘lock her up,’ and I felt — and I could have done it, but I felt it would have been a terrible thing. And then this happened to me.”\n\n“I didn’t say ‘lock her up,’ but the people said ‘lock her up, lock her up,’” Trump continued. “Then, we won. And I say — and I said pretty openly, I said, all right, come on, just relax, let’s go, we’ve got to make our country great.”\n\nTrump did repeatedly demand Clinton be sent to prison during his campaign, however, and the “lock her up” chant was a signature of his supporters at his rallies, even after the 2016 election.\n\nJust before that election, he did commit to investigate Clinton with a special counsel, though one was never appointed.\n\nIt’s unknown whether Trump will face a prison sentence after being convicted of falsifying business documents. The charges carry a maximum sentence of four years, though he could also be levied fines, home confinement or probation.\n\nHis sentencing is scheduled for July 11. Trump has appealed the conviction.",

            "summary": "As the saying sort of goes: Those who do not learn from history are destined to try desperately to rewrite it.\n\nFresh off his felony conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records, Donald Trump went on television to insist that he never directly called for the imprisonment of one of his old political enemies.\n\n“Hillary Clinton—I didn’t say, ‘Lock her up,’ but the people would all say, ‘Lock her up, lock her up,’” he said on Fox & Friends Weekend. “OK. Then we won, and I said pretty openly, I’d say, ‘Alright, come on, just relax. Let’s go. We gotta make our country great.’”\n\nIt had been Will Cain, sitting opposite Trump alongside co-hosts Rachel Campos-Duffy and Pete Hegseth, who’d provoked the former president’s remark. “You famously said, regarding Hillary Clinton, ‘Lock her up.’ You declined to do that as president,” Cain pointed out.\n\n“I beat her,” Trump replied. “It’s easier when you win. And they always said lock her up, and I felt—and I could have done it, but I felt it would have been a terrible thing. And then this happened to me.” He then launched into asserting that he’d never called for Clinton’s jailing.\n\nNone of the hosts pushed back on his claim. “But they want to lock you up over $130,000 of an accounting thing,” Campos-Duffy offered instead.\n\n“And a perfectly stated accounting thing,” Trump replied.\n\nOf course, Trump encouraged his supporters’ rallying cry during his first presidential campaign, and even used it several times himself. (Though Clinton was under intense scrutiny at the time amid a federal investigation into her classified email scandal, she was never charged with a crime.)\n\n“Every time I mention [Clinton], everyone screams, ‘Lock her up, lock her up,’” Trump said at a July 2016 rally in Colorado. “You know what, I’m starting to agree with you.”\n\nThree months later, he told a North Carolina crowd that “for what she’s done, they should lock her up” and a Pennsylvania audience that “‘lock her up’ is right.”\n\nHe deployed the infamous phrase as recently as 2020. On the same January night the Justice Department closed its two-year probe into Clinton’s emails, Ohio fans chanted “lock her up” at a Trump rally. “You should lock her up, I’ll tell you,” he agreed.\n\n“You should lock them up,” Trump added that October in Georgia. “Lock up the Bidens, lock up Hillary.”\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11. Though experts have agreed it is unlikely he will receive jail time for the class E felony charges, especially given his status as a first-time offender, each count of falsifying business records in the first degree does technically carry a maximum term of four years behind bars. He could also be fined or sentenced to home confinement or probation.",

Now that he is facing legal consequences for paying hush money to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, the former president is denying he ever said, “Lock her up,” about Hillary Clinton, his 2016 opponent.\n\n“You famously said regarding Hillary Clinton, ‘Lock her up.’ You declined to do that as president,” said Fox host Will Cain, implying that the president has control over who is prosecuted.\n\n“I beat her,” Trump replied. “It’s easier when you win. They always said, ‘Lock her up.’ And I could have done it, but I felt it would have been a terrible thing. And then this happened to me, so I may feel differently about it. I can’t tell you, I’m not sure I can answer the question,” Trump hemmed and hawed.\n\nHe continued, “Hillary Clinton — I didn’t say, ‘Lock her up,’ but the people would all say, ‘Lock her up, lock her up.’ OK. Then we won, and I said pretty openly, I’d say, ‘Alright, come on, just relax. Let’s go.

Trump not only beamed and nodded from the podium as his rally crowds chanted, “Lock her up,” he also said it himself, multiple times. He said it on Oct. 14, 2016, at a rally in Greensboro, N.C. As the crowd chanted the line, Trump said, “For what she’s done, they should lock her up.”\n\nTrump: Lock up the Bidens, lock up Hillary. Lock them up pic.twitter.com/QCOKUmHwVF — Acyn (@Acyn) October 16, 2020\n\nIn fact, he said it numerous times on the 2016 campaign trail, and he carried the line forward during his presidency. He even said it of Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in October 2020. When the crowd chanted, “Lock her up!” about Whitmer, Trump responded with, “Lock them all up.” And that same month, he told a crowd of the Bidens, “You should lock them up. Lock up the Bidens, lock up Hillary.”\n\nWhen a crowd chanted, “Lock her up!” about Dr. Christine Blasey-Ford, the professor who accused Supreme Court Justice Bret Kavanaugh of assaulting her when both were teens, Trump gave the crowd enthusiastic nods and a thumbs-up.\n\nAs recently as last August, Trump hinted he might attempt to lock up his opponents. In an interview with Glenn Beck, the host asked, “Do you regret not ‘locking her up.’ And if you’re president again, will you lock people up?” Trending Trump Denies Ever Saying 'Lock Her Up.'

Schiff Says He's 'Inciting Violence'\n\n“The answer is you have no choice, because they’re doing it to us,” Trump responded.\n\nEven with his conviction, it is unlikely that Trump himself will be “locked up” for any period of time. He will almost certainly appeal, and a prison sentence is unlikely for someone convicted of falsifying business records. But even though he faces a vanishingly small chance of time behind bars, Trump is all of a sudden painting himself as soft on crime.",

            "title": "After crackdown on Hong Kong, overseas communities carry the torch to keep Tiananmen memories alive",
            "summary": "HONG KONG (AP) — As the 35th anniversary of Beijing’s Tiananmen Square crackdown neared, Rowena He, a prominent scholar of that bloody chapter of modern China’s history, was busy flying between the United States, Britain and Canada to give a series of talks. Each was aimed at speaking out for those who cannot.\n\nThe 1989 crackdown, in which government troops opened fire on student-led pro-democracy protesters, resulting in hundreds, if not thousands, dead, remains a taboo subject in mainland China. In Hong Kong, once a beacon of commemorative freedom, the massive June 4 annual vigil that mourned the victims for decades has vanished, a casualty of the city’s clampdown on dissidents following huge anti-government protests in 2019.\n\nHe was still reeling from the loss of her academic position after Hong Kong authorities last year rejected her visa renewal, widely seen as a sign of the financial hub’s decline in intellectual freedom. Despite the exhausting schedule of talks, the former protester in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou in 1989 viewed this as her duty.\n\n“We cannot light the candles in Hong Kong anymore. So we would light it everywhere, globally,” she said.\n\nAs Beijing’s toughened political stance effectively extinguished any large-scale commemorations within its borders, overseas commemorative events have grown increasingly crucial for preserving memories of the Tiananmen crackdown. Over the past few years, a growing number of talks, rallies, exhibitions and plays on the subject have emerged in the U.S., Britain, Canada, Australia and Taiwan.\n\nThese activities foster hope and counteract the aggressive efforts to erase reminders of the crackdown, particularly those seen in Hong Kong. In 2021, the city’s police charged three leaders of the group that organized the vigil with subversion under a 2020 sweeping national security law that has all but wiped out public dissent. Later, the group voted to disband. Tiananmen-related statues were also removed from universities.\n\nLast week, under a new, home-grown security law, Hong Kong police arrested seven people on suspicion of alleged sedition over their posting of social media content about commemorating the Tiananmen crackdown. A Christian newspaper, which typically publishes content related to the event ahead of its anniversary, left its front page mostly blank. It said it could only turn words into blank squares and white space to respond to the current situation.\n\nOn Tuesday, the park that used to hold the vigil will be occupied by a carnival held by pro-Beijing groups.\n\nHowever, attempts to silence commemorative efforts have failed to erase the harrowing memories from the minds of a generation of liberal-minded Chinese in the years after tanks rolled into the heart of Beijing to break up weeks of student-led protests that had spread to other cities and were seen as a threat to Communist Party rule.\n\nHe, who was 17 years old at the time, recalls that protesters like her took to the streets out of love for their country. When the crackdown happened, she spent the entire night in front of her TV, unable to sleep. After she returned to school, she was required to recite the official narrative — that the government had successfully quelled a riot — in order to pass her exams.\n\n“I never killed anyone. But I lived with that survivor’s guilt all those years,” she said.\n\nTo preserve memories of the event, a museum dedicated to the Tiananmen crackdown opened in New York last June. It features exhibits such as a blood-stained shirt and a tent used by student protesters.\n\nA similar museum operated by vigil organizers was shuttered in Hong Kong in 2021.\n\nAs of early May, its board chair Wang Dan, also a leading former student leader of the Tiananmen protests, estimated the New York museum attracted about 1,000 people, including Chinese immigrants, U.S. citizens and Hong Kongers. To expand its audience, Wang said he plans to organize temporary exhibitions on university campuses in the U.S., and possibly in other countries over the longer term.\n\nHe said overseas memorial events are crucial because mainland Chinese and Hong Kongers can see overseas memorial activities online.\n\n“It can have an effect in mainland China because young people there all know how to use VPNs to circumvent internet censorship,” he said.\n\nAline Sierp, a professor of European history and memory studies at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, said overseas commemorative activities allow the memories to travel and endure, providing access for other people and future generations.\n\nBut she said it can be “a double-edged sword” because adapting the memories to new places might risk fragmenting or de-contextualizing them in the future.\n\nAlison Landsberg, a memory studies scholar at George Mason University in Virginia, said that overseas efforts carry the potential to inspire people from other places who are facing their own challenges in the pursuit of democracy.\n\nTo carry the memories forward, film and television dramas can be powerful tools for people to take on memories of events through which they didn’t live, she said.\n\nShe said overseas theater productions about the crackdown, which began last year in Taiwan and continued in London this year, have a greater possibility of making those connections and potentially reaching a broader audience.\n\n“When you have a dramatic narrative, you have the capacity to bring the viewer into the story in a kind of intimate way,” Landsberg said.\n\nLast week, members of an audience at a London theater were visibly moved, some to tears, after watching the play “May 35th,” a title that subtly references the June 4 crackdown.\n\nThe play, produced by Lit Ming-wai, part of the Hong Kong diaspora who moved to the U.K. after the enactment of the 2020 security law, tells the story of an elderly couple who wish to properly mourn their son who died in 1989.\n\nIts director, Kim Pearce, who was born in the U.K. in the 1980s, said the tragedy had resonated with her from a young age and she was once moved to tears when she read the poem “Tiananmen” by James Fenton. Working on this project, she said, has further deepened her connection to the stories.\n\nBritish theater-goer Sue Thomas, 64, also found the play deeply moving. “Particularly as a parent myself now, which I wasn’t then, which sort of made me think of it in a much more sort of heartfelt way,” she said.\n\nAt the theater, He, the scholar, served as one of the post-show speakers, sharing her struggles and the motivations behind her work with the audience. She said the play was so powerful that it made her relive the trauma of the past 35 years, leaving her in tears and causing her to lose her contact lenses.\n\n“It shows that how much sufferings that people had to endure all these years,” she said. “If there’s anything we can do, I hope that we would bring the younger generation to understand this.”\n\n___\n\nJi reported from London.",

            "title": "35 years after China's Tiananmen Square massacre: Why we must never forget",
            "summary": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nThe voices of the brave individuals who perished 35 years ago in the Tiananmen Square massacre continue to echo across our collective conscience.\n\nOn that day, the People’s Liberation Army, acting on the orders of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) leadership, murdered and injured thousands of peaceful pro-democracy protesters calling for political reform and an end to corruption.\n\nThe image of a lone protester using only his body to confront a row of tanks instantly became an enduring global symbol of resistance against oppression.\n\nIt was a day of immense tragedy, described as \"a bloodbath in the center of a world capital.\" The massacre shocked the international community, while also highlighting humanity’s innate desire for liberty.\n\nBIDEN ADMIN SLAMMED AS GRANTING ‘MAJOR COUP’ TO CHINA AFTER TOP OFFICIALS VISIT ON TIANANMEN MASSACRE DATE\n\nHowever, compounding this tragedy is the fact that today, most people under the age of 40 in 21st-century China have little to no understanding of the events that unfolded on June 4, 1989.\n\nAs reported by Radio Free Asia, educators are still forbidden from teaching about it, references to it are instantly removed from China’s heavily censored internet, and even public memorials for the victims are strictly prohibited.\n\nThere is one clear reason why the CCP has tried to wipe this dark chapter in China’s history from its public discourse: fear.\n\nThe shocking loss of innocent life, and the protests leading up to it, embody an unyielding demand for democracy and human rights – values that directly challenge President Xi Jinping's centralized and increasingly oppressive rule. Xi and the rest of the CCP believe that by erasing the memory of Tiananmen, they can stifle dissent and silence calls for freedom – and, to some extent, they have succeeded.\n\nTIANANMEN SQUARE: TAIWAN VIGIL REMEMBERS VICTIMS OF CHINA MASSACRE\n\nThis is precisely why we cannot allow the memory of Tiananmen to fade away. It is why we have come together to amplify the voices demanding democracy for China, ensuring that the courage and sacrifices of those who stood against tyranny are never forgotten.\n\nNearly a decade before that fateful day, the United States began engaging in normalization efforts with Beijing, believing its integration into the global economy would lead to greater civic freedoms for its people. Both Democratic and Republican administrations achieved some success in deepening diplomatic ties and widening people-to-people contacts and exchange programs, and U.S. multinationals reaped significant profits in the China market.\n\nBut, they were wrong. The strategic gamble that economic growth and global integration would lead to improvements in human rights and neighborly relations was a fatal error, one whose victims are the Chinese people themselves.\n\nIn recent years, the Chinese government has only gotten worse. Xi has intensified his control over his people while extending his nation’s authoritarian reach across borders through brazen acts of transnational repression.\n\nTIANANMEN SQUARE MASSACRE MASTERMIND KNOWN AS THE 'BUTCHER OF BEIJING' DIES\n\nHe has helped turn his country into an Orwellian surveillance state with formidable economic and military power, trampling over human rights with impunity, bullying its neighbors, and presenting itself as an alternative to democratic governance.\n\nIn response, the United States has more recently shifted its approach to addressing relations with China to prioritize national security over economic interests. We are diversifying our supply chains, limiting China’s access to technologies and products that could further enhance its economic and military capacity, and strengthening our defense alliances across the Indo-Pacific. While successive recent administrations have taken important action in this regard, it has often been the Congress that has led the way.\n\nAs we’ve learned before, this national security focus, while important, must not crowd out our focus on human rights. We must not overlook the aspirations and dignity of the Chinese people, who continue to strive for greater freedoms and economic opportunities in their own country.\n\nThe concerns of the United States lie squarely with Xi and his government, not the people of China, and we must continue our staunch support for them in their struggle for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Doing so is both a moral obligation and a strategic necessity for building stable international relations and bolstering our national security.\n\nCHINA'S SILENCING OF TIANANMEN TRIBUTES EXTENDS TO HONG KONG\n\nOur commitment to human rights around the world only holds weight when we boldly denounce violations wherever and whenever they occur, and take action. By uniting with a resolute voice at home, and drawing wisdom and strength from the lessons of history, we can pave the way for a more dignified and prosperous future for all people across the globe.\n\nThis unity of purpose should clearly convey our nation’s support for those who have made the ultimate sacrifice fighting for freedom against oppressive regimes, such as that of Xi, and forcefully condemn efforts to censor information, rewrite history, and suppress the truth about mass atrocities and crimes against humanity.\n\nThis is precisely what I aim to achieve by introducing a bipartisan resolution honoring the victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre.\n\nThis legislation represents a united call for justice, not only for the tragic events that transpired 35 years ago, but also for Beijing’s ongoing human rights abuses today, including the brutal repression of Tibetan and Uyghur communities. It highlights the systematic erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong and condemns Xi’s widespread use of transnational repression, which targets Chinese diaspora communities and activists globally.\n\nHONG KONG UNIVERSITY SAYS 'PILLAR OF SHAME' STATUE HONORING TIANANMEN SQUARE DEAD MUST COME DOWN\n\nBy shedding light on these issues, we can underscore the urgent need to hold the People’s Republic of China (PRC) accountable for its human rights abuses and to counter Xi's attempts to undermine international norms and threaten global security.\n\nIn commemorating the Tiananmen Square massacre, we honor the courageous spirit of those who embody what Nobel laureate and human rights activist Liu Xiaobo called \"the enduring human quest for freedom,\" be it in China or anywhere else in the world.\n\nWe see that spirit in the people of Taiwan and their newly elected president, Dr. Lai Ching-te, who share the very same democratic aspirations as the thousands of peaceful Chinese protesters who were killed and injured on that tragic day in 1989.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nWe ask our fellow Americans to join us in paying tribute to the heroes of Tiananmen Square by recognizing the sacrifices they made in pursuit of liberty, dignity, and self-determination.\n\nTogether, through our shared support for democracy and human rights, we can give voice to those silenced by the PRC and ensure that the legacy of Tiananmen continues to inspire generations to come.",

            "title": "China and Hong Kong reportedly detain dissidents before Tiananmen Square anniversary",
            "summary": "Chinese and Hong Kong authorities have arrested or put under surveillance several dissidents before the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre this week, according to human rights groups.\n\nOn 4 June it will be 35 years since Chinese soldiers shut down a weeks-long peaceful protest with violence, killing anything from several hundred to several thousand people.\n\nCommemorative events are planned in cities around the world, including Tokyo, London, Taipei and New York – where a museum dedicated to the massacre was opened last year – but not in the country where it occurred.\n\nThe event has been banned from public acknowledgment in China, prompting those who want to commemorate or discuss it to find creative ways to get around censors to avoid persecution.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said several individuals connected to the 4 June remembrance had been put under surveillance or temporarily moved from their homes by authorities. Among them were Zhan Xianling, a founding member of the Tiananmen Mothers group of victims’ relatives, the human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang, and the Guizhou student leader Ji Feng.\n\nMentions of the anniversary are largely impossible on China’s strictly controlled internet and media. Even obscure references in photos, words and dates are often blocked from social media posts.\n\nFamous photographs, such as that of the “tank man”, are banned, but so too are images or mentions of yellow rubber ducks after the toy became a popular replacement image. In 2022, one of China’s most popular shopping influencers was abruptly taken off air after a cake shaped like a tank was briefly shown on his live stream.\n\nView image in fullscreen A man stands in front of a line of tanks in Tiananmen Square in June 1989. Photograph: Jeff Widener/AP\n\nIn the lead-up to the anniversary, some platforms and institutions appeared to be removing any opportunity for memorial posts. On its Weibo account on Friday, World of Warcraft said its website would be undergoing maintenance from 3-5 June, and users would be unable to log in or leave messages. On Saturday, a secondary school in Shanxi issued a notice to staff telling them not to post on social media until notified, and that assembly and religious activities were banned on 4 June, according to “Teacher Li”, who runs an information-sharing and activism-monitoring account on X.\n\nFor three decades, the largest Tiananmen memorial event was held in Hong Kong, but under a tightening crackdown by the city’s government against the pro-democracy movement, that too has been banned. Attempts to organise candlelit vigils across the city and in homes have resulted in arrests.\n\nLast week, Hong Kong police used a new national security law to arrest seven people, accusing them of publishing messages with seditious intent ahead of an “upcoming sensitive date”.\n\nThe police searched homes and seized electronic devices. “Those who intend to endanger national security should not imagine that they can avoid police pursuit anonymously online,” the police said.\n\nOne of the women arrested was already in prison. Local media identified her as Chow Hang-tung, a prominent barrister and human rights activist who has been jailed on other charges.\n\nChow’s case is the subject of a documentary that will be screened at a 4 June event in Japan on Tuesday. She had been an organiser of Hong Kong’s Tiananmen Vigils, with the since-disbanded Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China. However, in December 2022, she and others were charged with “inciting others to take part in an unauthorised assembly”. Chow was acquitted, but that was then overturned by the court of appeal in January.\n\n“The Chinese government is seeking to erase memory of the Tiananmen massacre throughout China and in Hong Kong,” said Maya Wang, the acting China director at Human Rights Watch. “But 35 years on, the government has been unable to extinguish the flames of remembrance for those risking all to promote respect for democracy and human rights in China.”\n\nThe introduction of two new national security laws since 2020 have driven a climate of fear and self-censorship in Hong Kong, where activists, media, and others say it is not clear where the red lines are for authorities.\n\nIn its most recent issue, Hong Kong’s Christian Times newspaper published mostly blank space on its front page. It also did not publish it online as usual, saying it could not do so because of “circumstances”.\n\nIn an editorial, the paper, which in the past has often published articles about the Tiananmen anniversary, said society had become “restrictive”, and it could only “respond to the current situation by turning paragraphs into blank squares and white space”.\n\n“Even a prayer that originates from historical memories may arouse ‘concern’,” it said.\n\n“Facing history honestly is not to perpetuate grievances, nor to smear and incite, but to give future repentance and reconciliation a solid foundation.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Chi-hui Lin",

            "title": "New York museum ‘keeps memories alive’ 35 years after Tiananmen crackdown",
            "summary": "A bloodied blouse, a tent and a military medal are among the exhibits commemorating China’s brutal suppression of student protests in 1989.\n\nNew York City – When Zhou Fengsuo last saw the mimeograph machine, he was running for his life as the tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square in Beijing in June 1989.\n\nFor weeks before that night of bloodshed, Zhou had used the machine, a state-of-the-art photocopier at the time, to churn out leaflets to spread the message of China’s pro-democracy movement.\n\nAs one of the last student leaders to leave the square, Zhou tried to talk fellow demonstrators out of heaving the 40-pound (18kg) hulk of solid metal. This may come in handy someday, they argued, and hauled it away on bicycles.\n\nMore than three decades later, Zhou was stunned to see that the bulky relic of the rebellion had been secreted out of China for a new museum in New York.\n\nThe June 4th Memorial Museum opened a year ago through concerted efforts by Zhou and a few other veterans of the Tiananmen demonstrations now living in the United States. The urgency for a new museum came after the one in Hong Kong was closed down by the authorities there in 2021.\n\n“We viewed this as the effort to erase the memories,” David Dahai Yu, the museum’s director, told Al Jazeera. “We want people to understand why [Tiananmen] happened and what it means…to tell the story.”\n\nOn June 4, 1989, the Chinese government deployed armed troops to crush mass student-led protests that had occupied Tiananmen Square for weeks. At least hundreds of protesters and bystanders, if not more, are believed to have been killed.\n\nIn the years afterwards, Hong Kong held an annual mass candlelight vigil for all those who perished, without any interference from Chinese authorities who snubbed out even private memorials in mainland China. And finally, in 2014, the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, a coalition initially formed in 1989 to help the mainland protesters, founded the museum.\n\nTimes have changed, however. Since 2020, the only city on Chinese soil where the public was free to mark June 4th is now under two draconian national security laws, which ban the annual vigil with threats of arrest and jail time. The Hong Kong museum was shut down just two days before the 32nd anniversary in 2021 and all the exhibits were confiscated.\n\n‘So much that I never knew’\n\nNot all was lost. Instead, as news of the US museum spread, more artefacts from that heady Beijing spring began to appear.\n\nSoon after Zhou and others spread the word on their new museum in the heart of Manhattan’s shopping district, they started receiving unexpected items: the blood-splattered blouse of a reporter who worked for the People’s Liberation Army newspaper; the leaflets distributed by Zhou; a medal and commemorative watch awarded to “the defenders of the motherland”, as Beijing dubbed the soldiers who suppressed the movement.\n\nThere was even a like-new Nikko tent, one of the hundreds ferried in from Hong Kong and kept as a memento by a pair of protesters who camped in the square as newlyweds.\n\nAnother item bound for the museum was an installation by exiled Chinese artist Chen Weimin, which had been displayed for decades in a California desert.\n\nAn avid collector of all things Tiananmen, Zhou told Al Jazeera: “I learned in the process so much that I never knew before.”\n\nZhou was jailed in China for one year for his involvement in the protests before settling in the US in the early 1990s and founding a humanitarian NGO.\n\nIn recent years, he has been helping Hong Kong protesters who fled surveillance and arrest. He asked some of them to fill a room in the museum with an illustrated timeline of the 2019 antigovernment protests. A construction worker’s helmet and a yellow umbrella used by a protester were donated to the museum.\n\nOne of the 2019 protesters has parlayed his visual art training and renovation skills into designing the exhibit.\n\n“It’s difficult to explain to outsiders why Hong Kong resorted to violent struggles,” said Locky Mak, 25, who landed in New York last year with only a backpack and requested to be known only by a pseudonym for fear of reprisal. “That said, I feel that [the Tiananmen veterans] admire the Hong Kong people and are very supportive of our struggles.”\n\nFor Zhou, the focus of all the remembrances is not just about the tragic end. “It’s also about hope and solidarity: the other possibility for China,” he said.\n\nHowever, splits emerged soon after Wang Dan, one of the most prominent Tiananmen student leaders and one of the museum’s founders, faced a slew of sexual harassment accusations and related civil lawsuits in Taipei, where he sometimes resides and where he co-founded the New School for Democracy in 2011.\n\nWhen a group of mainland Chinese students in New York called out Wang in a public statement, they were banned from hosting events at the museum. Yu said he made the decision after they refused to retract their statement, which he called “one-sided”.\n\nEven into its second year of operations, the all-volunteer-run museum has kept limited hours: opening only two days a week for four hours at a time. Fundraising, which kicked off in 2021 soon after the demise of the Hong Kong museum and buoyed by great enthusiasm, has grown sluggish and remains far short of the $2m initial goal. The $580,000 raised so far is sufficient for two more years of operations, according to Yu.\n\nJiao Ruilin, 31, started volunteering as a museum guide last July 2023, two months after leaving his native Shanghai for freedom in the US. Before, Jiao would learn dribs and drabs about Tiananmen by eavesdropping on whispers among his relatives.\n\n“The exhibits have opened my eyes to the harm of the dictatorship,” Jiao said. “Of course, I want China to change, but I also realise the power of individuals may fall short in affecting change.”\n\nEven so, the Tiananmen veterans are resolved to carry on. Except for a few fake Facebook pages, they said there has been no transnational sabotage from Beijing so far, despite the country’s growing international reach.\n\nAndrew Nathan, a sinologist at New York’s Columbia University who co-edited The Tiananmen Papers, a trove of secret Chinese official documents on the protests and the crackdown, believes the resurrected museum is serving an important role.\n\n“There’s nothing else that keeps the memories alive,” said Nathan.",

Twenty thousand shot up, wounded, put on ships, buried at sea,\" said Don Graves, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who served in Iwo Jima in the Pacific theater.\n\n\"I want the younger people, the younger generation here to know what we did,\" said Graves, part of a group of more than 60 World War II veterans who flew into Paris on Saturday.\n\nAmerican D-Day veteran Anthony Pagano arrives at Charles de Gaulle airport, Saturday, June 1, 2024 in Roissy, north of Paris.

We never talked about it I think. For 70 years I didn't talk about it,\" said another of the veterans, Ralph Goldsticker, a U.S. Air Force captain who served in the 452nd Bomb Group.\n\nOf the D-Day landings, he recalled seeing from his aircraft \"a big, big chunk of the beach with thousands of vessels\" and spoke of bombing raids against German strongholds and routes that German forces might otherwise have used to rush in reinforcements to push the invasion back into the sea.\n\n\"I dropped my first bomb at 06:58 a.m. in a heavy gun placement,\" he said. \"We went back home, we landed at 09:30. We reloaded.\"\n\nPart of the purpose of fireworks shows, parachute jumps, solemn commemorations and ceremonies that world leaders will attend this week is to pass the baton of remembrance to the current generations now seeing war again in Europe, in Ukraine.

            "summary": "Editor’s Note: As the 80th anniversary of D-Day nears, the global fight for democracy continues. CNN Anchor and Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper speaks with World War II veterans and military generals about the worldwide erosion of democratic institutions. “D-Day: Why We Still Fight for Democracy” premieres Sunday, June 2 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on CNN.\n\nCaen, France CNN —\n\nAt 99 years old, Jack Foy is considered the youngster among his group of friends that fought in World War II.\n\nBut their advanced age isn’t going to stop them from making the transatlantic journey to honor their fallen comrades on the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\n\nOn June 6, Foy – a survivor of the Battle of the Bulge – and his fellow American veterans will join dignitaries and heads of state from around the world to commemorate the approximately 160,000 Allied troops who, eight decades ago, carried out the largest seaborne invasion in human history.\n\nFoy told CNN that he has been to several memorials in France since 2014. The emotional resonance of each trip grows stronger year after year, he said, because these veterans know each trip could be their last.\n\n“We realize we’re getting to the end of our time,” Foy said.\n\nThey are not alone.\n\nWith major commemorations held every five years, organizers and government officials concede that this year’s event could be the last to involve living veterans, whose stories of the horrors of war have become particularly poignant given that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought a large-scale ground war back to Europe for the first time since 1945.\n\n“We are perfectly aware that for these centenarians, this is maybe the last chance to return to the beaches where they landed, where they fought and where their brothers-in-arms fell,” said Gen. Michel Delion, the CEO of the French government agency in charge of the French commemoration efforts, Mission Liberation.\n\nWorld War II veteran Jack Foy shakes the hand of the then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley, at last year's D-Day anniversary. 1st Lt. Katherine Sibilla\n\nThe various countries putting together the event are now planning what is expected to be the most extensive D-Day commemoration in history – both in terms of size and, crucially for elderly veterans, logistics.\n\nApproximately 150 American veterans are expected to travel to Normandy – about two dozen of whom actually fought on D-Day – said Charles Djou, the secretary of the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC), the independent agency responsible for managing US military cemeteries and monuments overseas. The youngest is 96.\n\nFifteen Canadian veterans, including three or four that fought on D-Day, are traveling with the Canadian delegation, according to John Desrosiers, the director of international operations for Veterans Affairs Canada. Desrosiers said the youngest traveling with the group is 98 and the eldest are 104.\n\nThe British defense ministry said it expects more than 40 WWII veterans at the various events in Normandy.\n\nUS D-Day veterans attend an event at the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial as part of the 79th anniversary D-Day celebrations on June 6, 2023. Christopher Furlong/Getty Images\n\nThose vets will be joined by about 25 heads of state and government, including US President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Russian President Vladimir Putin was not extended an invitation due to the war in Ukraine, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is planning on attending, according to a French presidential source.\n\nWith so many heads of state in town, the security measures in place are intense. A massive contingent of 12,000 security personnel will be deployed on June 6, the French Interior Ministry said.\n\nHeavy travel restrictions put in place by French authorities will also effectively cut off the Norman coastline and the normally sleepy towns that dot it from the rest of the country.\n\nYet June 6 typically sees these elderly men criss-cross the region to hit a full day’s itinerary, including national ceremonies held at the American, British and Canadian cemeteries; the big international commemoration put on by France; and then, if they have the energy, more local events.\n\nMost veterans also travel with an entire phalanx of medical personnel. The charity that organized Foy’s trip, the US-based Best Defense Foundation, is bringing three doctors and 10 nurses to accompany the 50 veterans they are flying over from the United States. Each veteran will travel with a personal caregiver – typically a family member or a friend.\n\nOfficials say they are going to incredible lengths to treat veterans like royalty – as they are feted by actual royals. King Charles III will be there on June 6 – his first overseas trip since being diagnosed with cancer – alongside Queen Camilla and Prince William, Buckingham Palace said. Representatives from the royal families of Belgium, Monaco, the Netherlands and Norway are also expected to attend.\n\nDelion’s team has been holding rehearsals and timing wheelchair runs for the French-led international ceremony. They are also considering having veterans enter at the same time as heads of states and other dignitaries to reduce their waiting time.\n\nAmerican and Canadian organizers told CNN that they will seat veterans last at their respective national ceremonies to keep them comfortable. The general public at the American event, for example, may need to be seated about an hour in advance due to security precautions.\n\n“We take care of the veterans who served and made the enormous sacrifices that they did in the Second World War,” said Djou.\n\nBritish D-Day veteran Tom Schaffer (left), and companion John Pinkerton study the names on the British Normandy Memorial at Ver-sur-Mer in France ahead of the 79th anniversary of the D-Day landings in June 2023.

Allied planes and warships began their bombardment at about 6:30 a.m., with troops hitting the beaches shortly after. They landed on a stretch of coastline 50 miles long organized into five beaches codenamed Gold, Juno, Omaha, Sword and Utah. The Americans were responsible for Omaha and Utah. The British led the assault on Gold and Sword, while the Canadians handled Juno.\n\nThough 4,414 Allied troops died that day and it would take more than a month to achieve one of D-Day’s main objectives – liberating the strategically important city of Caen – the landings were considered a success. Allied troops had successfully made it onshore in France; it was the beginning of the end for Hitler and Nazi Germany.\n\nAmerican troops march up from Omaha Beach on June 18, 1944. Underwood Archives/Getty Images\n\nThe sheer drama of the event has, for decades, captured the American public imagination, because of both the magnitude of the invasion and the fact that it was a “digestible” turning point in the war, according to Ben Brands, a military historian at the ABMC.\n\n“World War II, especially in Europe, becomes this ongoing battle from basically the moment troops land on the beaches of D-Day until Germany ultimately surrenders. The human mind needs to cut that up into digestible stories, and D-Day is a really powerful, discrete event that is so critical for everything that comes after,” Brands said. “There’s just so many powerful stories that come out of D-Day.”\n\nUS military personnel place US and French flags next to the graves of fallen soldiers at the Normandy American Cemetery on June 5, 2023 in Colleville-sur-Mer, France. Christopher Furlong/Getty Images\n\nAs time has passed, veterans have played a crucial role in passing down the stories of D-Day. Their gripping, visceral first-hand accounts are better teachers of history than any textbook.\n\nBut just a fraction of the soldiers who lived through D-Day are still alive.\n\nOf the 16.4 million Americans who served in the military during WWII, fewer than 100,000 are expected to still be alive by the end of the year, according to statistics from the US Department of Veterans Affairs. In Canada, there were just 9,297 living Canadian veterans who had served in either WWII or the Korean War as of March 31, 2023, according to the most recent statistics available from Veterans Affairs Canada. The British defense ministry said it does not keep veteran numbers on hand.\n\nIt’s unclear what the average age of a WWII veteran is. Given that the median age for an American WWII veteran in June 2020 was 93, according to US Census figures at the time, most surviving vets from Allied forces are likely to now be at least in their late-nineties. By the 85th anniversary in 2029, those who are still living will almost certainly be in triple digits.\n\n“People are realizing this generation is passing and they’re passing rapidly now, and it’s important to keep their stories alive, to keep the memories of those who died and are buried at Normandy, but also those who fought and survived because they can no longer be with us for that much longer to tell these stories,” Brands said.\n\n“The 80th will be a very powerful event.”",

But he will be feted in France as one of 60 American veterans of that conflict traveling to Normandy to mark the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\n“I know my brother and I never looked at it as we were any kind of heroes, nothing like that,” Margol said recently of himself and his twin brother Howard, who served with him. “It was just our time. That we were asked to serve. And we did.”\n\nThe 100-year-old Margol, who lives in suburban Atlanta, is among the dwindling band of veterans of the conflict leaving Atlanta on Sunday on a chartered flight for Deauville, Normandy. The veterans will take part in parades, school visits and ceremonies — including the official June 6 commemoration of the landings by soldiers from across the United States, Britain, Canada and other Allied nations on five beaches.\n\nMargol didn’t land at D-Day, but the Jacksonville, Florida, native was among those who liberated the Dachau Concentration Camp on April 29, 1945.\n\nThe trip also includes high school and college students selected to escort the veterans and learn about their experiences. Charter flights also took veterans from Atlanta to France in 2022 and 2023.\n\nOn Sunday, the group of 60 veterans, donning customized jackets commemorating the anniversary, arrived at the Atlanta airport to the clapping and cheering from the flight crew and the Dutchtown High School marching band from Hampton, Georgia. The veterans were then guided through the airport to their terminal in a parade headed by the marching band.\n\nWorld War II veterans Andy Negra, left, and Hilbert Margol, speak to each other during an an event honoring the two on Thursday, March 14, 2024, in Atlanta.

Reflecting back on the three years he was in Europe, Larson said he is “no hero.”\n\n“I’m just a survivor, but I’m here to honor those people who gave their life so I can be here,” Larson said Sunday before the flight.\n\nHe also had a message to world leaders: \"“Make peace not war.”\n\nAndy Negra of Helen, Georgia came ashore with the 6th Armored Division at Utah Beach on July 18, 1944, about six weeks after D-Day.

            "summary": "CNN —\n\nRepublican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump said Sunday that Maryland Republican Senate candidate Larry Hogan “doesn’t deserve the respect” of any Republican after he urged Americans to respect the verdict in Donald Trump’s hush money trial before it was delivered.\n\nSpeaking with CNN’s Kasie Hunt on “State of the Union,” Lara Trump called Hogan’s comments “ridiculous” and said the former Maryland governor “should have thought long and hard” before releasing his statement.\n\n“I’ll tell you one thing, I don’t support what he just said there. I think it’s ridiculous,” Lara Trump, who is also the former president’s daughter-in-law, said. “He doesn’t deserve the respect of anyone in the Republican Party at this point, and quite frankly, anybody in America, if that’s the way you feel. That’s very upsetting to hear that.”\n\nLast week, Hogan had urged Americans to “respect the verdict and the legal process” before a Manhattan jury found Donald Trump guilty of all 34 charges of falsifying business records. The unprecedented and historic verdict makes Trump the first former president in American history to be convicted of a felony.\n\n“At this dangerously divided moment in our history, all leaders—regardless of party—must not pour fuel on the fire with more toxic partisanship. We must reaffirm what has made this nation great: the rule of law,” Hogan had said.\n\nAsked Sunday whether the RNC would withhold money from Hogan’s campaign, Lara Trump declined to answer directly but again called Hogan’s statement “ridiculous.”\n\n“I’ll get back to you on all the specifics monetarily. But what I can tell you is that, as the Republican Party co-chair, I think he should never have said something like that,” she said.\n\nHogan winning the Senate seat in Maryland would be a pickup for Republicans in a Democratic state. He was first elected governor in 2014, comfortably won reelection in 2018 and left office in January 2023 with high approval ratings.\n\nIn recent decades, Maryland has been dominated by the Democratic Party at the state and federal levels. George H.W. Bush was the last Republican presidential nominee to win the Old Line State, in 1988.\n\nLara Trump added Sunday that “the American people have really spoken up” after the hush money conviction.\n\n“The American people came out and in 48 hours after Donald Trump’s verdict was read, our campaign and the RNC raised $70 million in digital fundraising,” she said.\n\n“I think that that was a very quick, very rapid and very strong response from the American people. It has gone way too far,” Lara Trump added. “The American people are upset and they spoke out about it.”",

Luke Hales / Getty Images\n\nWhile in office, Trump took issue with the social media app being controlled by a China-based parent company, trying unsuccessfully to ban the app in the U.S. with an executive order. Earlier this year, a renewed push against the app gained momentum in Congress, as lawmakers approved a foreign aid package that included a provision that required its sale within a year or a ban from U.S. app stores.\n\nBut before Congress approved and President Biden signed the legislation that could lead to a ban on TikTok into law, Trump changed his tune. He argued that banning TikTok would benefit Facebook, which he called the \"true Enemy of the People.\"\n\nTrump's super PAC joined TikTok last month, despite his previous views. At the time, Taylor Budowich, the CEO of MAGA Inc., said in a post on X that \"we will ensure President Trump's America First agenda is brought to every corner of the internet and every precinct of this country.\"\n\nThe development comes months after Mr. Biden's reelection campaign launched its own account on TikTok, despite his administration's support for the legislation that could lead to a ban.

Immediately following Trump's conviction on Thursday, the stock was down roughly 15% in extended trading hours.\n\nTrump launched Truth Social in early 2022 as an alternative, \"non-woke\" social media platform after he was banned from sites like Twitter and Facebook following the Jan. 6 Capitol riots. Since then, Trump Media has gone public and the former president now holds a 65% stake in the company.\n\nTruth Social did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment about Trump's move to TikTok.\n\nTrump is several months later than his Democratic opponent, President Joe Biden, whose reelection campaign launched on TikTok in February. But the presumptive Republican presidential nominee already had over 2 million followers on Sunday, outpacing the Biden campaign's near 340,000.\n\nThe disparity in those follower counts is typical for social media accounts directly attached to a specific candidate, which generally tend to outperform accounts associated with a campaign. For example, as of Sunday, Trump's direct Truth Social account, \"@realDonaldTrump\" had over 7 million followers, while his campaign account, \"@TeamTrump\" had 427,000.\n\n\"We refuse to cede any ground to Biden and the Democrats,\" Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to NBC News on Sunday. \"We will get President Trump's winning message to every voter possible.

According to Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung, the campaign will leave “no front undefended and this represents the continued outreach to a younger audience consuming pro-Trump and anti-Biden content,” he said in a statement.\n\nWhile he may be embracing TikTok now, as president, Trump signed an executive order in 2020 that said “the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned” by Chinese companies presented a threat to national security. TikTok sued and successfully blocked the order.\n\nIn April, Congress passed a bill Biden later signed that could effectively bar the app in the U.S. unless its owner, ByteDance, sells TikTok to an American company. The bill came to fruition out of fears that ByteDance may be trying to influence U.S. elections and could expose Americans’ data to China’s government. TikTok has filed suit to combat the legislation, claiming it violates the First Amendment.\n\n“Congress has taken the unprecedented step of expressly singling out and banning TikTok: a vibrant online forum for protected speech and expression used by 170 million Americans to create, share, and view videos over the Internet,” the company wrote in the suit.\n\nThe federal government, including the F.B.I. and the Federal Communications Commission, has cautioned that Americans’ data held by ByteDance — including browsing habits, location history, and biometric information — could be shared with the Chinese government.

Satirical, fake AI-generated clips show Rishi Sunak declaring, “Please don’t vote us out, we would be proper gutted!” and making unevidenced claims about how the Conservative leader is spending public money - including how he will send his “mates loads of dosh”.\n\nWatch: Marianna Spring explains the Undercover Voters project in 60 seconds\n\nOther AI-generated videos share misleading claims about his national service pledge for 18-year-olds, suggesting young people would be sent to current war zones in Ukraine and Gaza. Some of these are described as satire or parody in captions, but the comments suggest some users are confused about which claims are factual. TikTok told the BBC it had increased its investment in countering misinformation for the UK general election, including adding a fact-checking expert to existing resources and employing AI-labelling technology. The videos were spotted as part of the BBC's Undercover Voters project, which has created profiles for 24 fictional people on all the major social media sites, based on data and analysis by the National Centre for Social Research (Natcen).\n\nIn a satirical deepfake, Rishi Sunak appeared to say he would be \"proper gutted\" if he lost - but some users were confused about whether it was real\n\nThe fictional profiles represent a range of voters in battleground constituencies across the UK, giving an insight into what content is promoted to different types of people. The profiles are private, with no friends. They just like, follow and watch content relevant to their character traits informed by the Natcen research. I examined the feeds of the profiles of three of these fictional voters in the former “red wall” constituency of Bishop Auckland, a target for Labour which is currently held by the Conservatives - and where our Undercover Voters are younger. Their social media feeds revealed that, while other sites have also experienced a flurry of political content, TikTok had the most lively conversation, particularly among younger voters. TikTok has boomed since the last election. According to media regulator Ofcom, it was the fastest-growing source of news in the UK for the second year in a row in 2023 - used by 10% of adults in this way. One in 10 teenagers say it is their most important news source. TikTok is engaging a new generation in the democratic process. Whether you use the social media app or not, what is unfolding on its site could shape narratives about the election and its candidates - including in ways that may be unfounded. Content promoted to Undercover Voter character Jack, a disaffected 31-year-old, include TikToks misrepresenting remarks made by Labour politicians in speech bubbles. These include comments about immigration, transgender rights, Brexit - and false claims that the shadow international development secretary called to “abolish the Army”.\n\nA video made reference to the unfounded story that Sir Keir Starmer was involved in the decision not to prosecute serial paedophile Jimmy Savile\n\nSeveral other videos repeated the unfounded allegations about Sir Keir and Jimmy Savile. Other videos Jack was served on his feed included clips with threats in the comments about “euthanizing” Rishi Sunak and racist remarks about him. Messages such as “vote Reform UK” were shared repeatedly in the comments of many videos, much more than those I saw in support of any other party. TikTok users have begun to notice the comments, with many calling the posters “Reform bots”, suggesting they could be fake, automated accounts. I contacted some of the commenters who had photos and names on their profiles, and they told me they were real people based in the UK with no official affiliation to Reform UK and with no encouragement or instruction from the party. But others were anonymous with no profile image and numerical usernames - common hallmarks of fake accounts - and they did not respond to my messages.\n\nRepeated comments supporting Reform UK have prompted the nickname \"Reform bots\"\n\nWhether they are real people or not, their comments can create the impression that their preferred party has greater support. Another Undercover Voter character based in Bishop Auckland, 25-year-old Chloe, was created to have no prior interest in politics. But about one in 10 posts on her TikTok feed was a political meme or funny video, including official content coming from the Labour Party, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Reform UK. These include Rishi Sunak’s first TikTok on the Conservatives’ new account about national service, clarifying that he is not forcing all 18-year-olds to join the army. They also include a video of Cilla Black singing Surprise Surprise from the official Labour profile - with a caption saying “POV: Rishi Sunak turning up on your 18th birthday to send you to war”.\n\nOne post claimed without evidence that the election had been called because a scandal about Rishi Sunak was \"about to erupt\"\n\nA third Undercover Voter named Louise - in her 50s and politically undecided - was pushed more TikToks targeting political leaders with abusive comments, as well as satirical montages and parody videos about policy announcements such as national service. I tracked down some of the people behind the videos and posts shown to our Undercover Voters. One 16-year-old from the south of England, who made a satirical edit of that first Rishi Sunak TikTok about national service, said she was surprised how quickly her content took off. “I didn’t specifically create this account for the election and the reason I made the TikTok initially was just for a joke - I didn’t expect to get over 400k bloody views,” she said, adding that she is not affiliated with any party and has not received any money for creating the TikTok. “Social media really is the only platform for young people to have a voice nowadays in my opinion.” She said she knows satirical content can be “controversial” and she understands how her video “could mislead people” but would hope people could tell it was supposed to be a bit of fun. Alongside the video, some users had posted threatening comments towards Mr Sunak, but the 16-year-old said she did not think anyone would actually want to harm a politician.\n\nThere are 24 Undercover Voters in eight consituencies across the UK. For this story, we looked at three in Bishop Auckland\n\nDozens of other users I messaged who are creating this content are also in their late teens or early 20s, and want to get involved in creating political videos to engage other people their age in the election. They all tell me that while they may support a political party, they have not been paid for their posts and are not officially affiliated with any of the campaigns. One politics student tells me they “don’t worry about misleading people because the parties mislead others with their opinions about other parties”. Another person based in Coventry, who shares his videos about Reform UK, tells me he hopes to “boost their popularity in an unofficial way” and says he set up his account back in February. He say he is a member of the party and has not received any money for making his TikToks. He is concerned that satirical content - including his own - might unintentionally mislead people on TikTok. His account was restricted by TikTok for posting spam. A spokesperson for TikTok told the BBC that it had increased its investment “in efforts to ensure reliable information can be found on TikTok”, launching a “UK Election Centre with a fact-checking expert” and adopting an “industry-leading AI labelling technology”. It also said it was introducing “more policies to aggressively counter foreign election interference” and that it removed 97% of videos with misinformation about elections and civic issues before anyone had viewed them.",

            "title": "Labour is already dominating the online general election campaign",
            "summary": "The video opens with an old clip of Cilla Black singing her classic ‘Surprise, Surprise!’. The caption reads “POV: Rishi Sunak turns up at your 18th birthday to send you to war.”\n\nThis appeared on Labour’s TikTok account the day after the Conservatives launched their national service policy. It fitted perfectly with TikTok’s meme-heavy, wry and sarcastic culture and has been watched 4.5 million times. The video racked up almost 700,000 likes, more than double the likes on all the Tories’ TikToks put together.\n\nThe 2024 general election will be the most online election ever. But as our digital lives get more complex and people’s methods of getting information and interacting with each other diversify, so the campaigns must take their digital footprints farther afield.\n\nOnline campaigning has changed dramatically. There are more platforms, with voter-siloing as a byproduct. Voters discuss politics with friends in private spaces like WhatsApp groups now, rather than public spaces like Facebook walls. There is more money for parties’ digital teams. And online campaigning is now totally ubiquitous. All this has implications for the nature, scale and approach of the parties’ digital operations.\n\nThe election announcement shocked Westminster. But it should not have shocked the PM’s own party. Yet during week one, it was Labour that had a smoother launch, with content hammering away at a single, simpl message – “change” – while the Tories laboured to get their operation going. Labour’s content on social media feels more nimble, more accessible and of higher quality. Sunak’s operation comes across as scrappier and thrown together.\n\nIf this is a TikTok election, then Labour is walking it. But is this a TikTok election? In a word, probably no. So what is happening online? Away from the excitement of X and TikTok, the big battle for voters’ attention is through paid media: targeted Facebook and Instagram posts, ads that show up when a voter googles something. Videos played before football highlights on YouTube. Here, Labour is also out of the gates a lot faster. During Sunak’s Downing Street speech, more than 150 local Labour candidates launched slick, on-message, locally targeted video ads, pumping their message out in key seats before tight election spending limits kicked in a week later. According to numbers from the ‘Who Targets Me’ monitoring website, Labour outspent the Tories by £350k to £50k on Google/YouTube in the first week and by about £500k to about £200k on Facebook. There is a widely held perception that the Conservatives have a huge war-chest to spend online in this campaign. If that’s true, they’re holding it back for later.\n\nDigital campaigning comes down to a few fundamentals: a clear message, the ability to create content that carries the message in a way that delivers the desired response, and the money and methods to get that content in front of the right people. Aside from digital communications to reach voters, parties are trying to use them to mobilise their own activists.\n\nSupporters on Labour’s email list are getting much higher traffic with requests for donations and to join canvassing sessions. I am told Labour raised more than £1m in the first 48 hours of the election. Both parties will use email, social media and video to persuade members and supporters to get active offline, too, knocking on doors and making phone calls to potential supporters.\n\nBut what about voters? How does any of this help everyday people? For all the ills of social media toxicity, the advent of digital campaigning and communication has opened up new spaces and ways for voters to learn about parties and candidates, and to be participants in the election. People want to engage actively online, not just be passively served content.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Election Edition Free daily newsletter Make sense of the UK election campaign with Archie Bland's daily briefing, direct to your inbox at 5pm (BST).

Now they're racing to build them on the fly.\n\nLabour has found success by posting lots of videos, and using rapid reaction memes like this, which has racked up millions of likes.\n\nTikTok TikTok , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

So it just goes to show that the cut-through happens not just with younger voters as well. There's a lot of middle-aged and older demographics increasingly using TikTok to get their news and information, and they use it.\"\n\nThere's also another dynamic. Having seen the trouble that other platforms have gotten into, TikTok has a blanket ban on political advertising.\n\nThe millions of pounds we have already seen poured into Instagram and YouTube don't work here. So organic reach becomes key.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nAnd, behind closed doors, both parties have tools for boosting that reach.\n\nThe Conservatives have been heavily pushing their Share 2 Win app. It makes it very easy for users to share messages from Conservative HQ to various social media platforms. Notably, TikTok is not one of them.\n\nThe more you share on your own social platforms, the more coins you earn, with a chance to jump up the leaderboard.\n\nLabour has a slightly different emphasis. Its Labour digital campaigners group runs on WhatsApp and offers links to national and local graphics and encourages people to send in their own stories and why people may be voting Labour.\n\nThe idea is not simply to share centrally approved content, though. At a recent online seminar over Zoom, on how to master the \"digital door knock\", the main points were to share messages organically and through friends and family groups online, rather than repost videos of politicians.\n\n\"Keep it personal\" was the title of one of the slides, whilst another gave four tips for telling a good story - one of the tips being \"don't be too political\".\n\n\"That sharing from your friends, from your family, can be more persuasive than just kind of saying something that's broadcast from a political party,\" Professor Dommett explains.\n\n\"So this is where organic comes in. It's something that pops up, you know, it's often shared by someone that we know, and therefore it's likely to resonate a little bit more.\"",

You know, he just loved helping people. That's just how Jamal was, he always wanted to be a help to somebody.”\n\nMitchell, 36, was killed in the line of duty on Thursday while responding to a shooting in Minneapolis’ Whittier neighborhood. He was one of three people that died, including the shooter. At least four other people were injured.\n\nCreate a More Connected Minnesota MPR News is your trusted resource for the news you need.

They drove from Minnesota to Connecticut to see family for the holiday. Dennis Ray Edwards Sr.\n\nOn Thursday evening, Mitchell and other emergency responders were dispatched after a report of a double shooting near 22nd Street and Blaisdell Avenue. He was shot while attempting to give medical aid to someone a block away from the incident, and later died of his injuries.\n\n“That in itself, that’s just who Jamal instinctively was. That is a tribute to his foundation, putting others first. Living a selfless life to impact someone’s heart, to impact someone’s life,” said Denise Raper, Mitchell’s aunt and godmother.\n\nMitchell was born and raised in Connecticut and has six other siblings. He moved to Minnesota about five years ago and has been raising his three kids in Minneapolis with his girlfriend. His kids are 9, 7 and 5-years-old.\n\nIn 2022, Mitchell became a police officer at the Minneapolis Police Department. Raper-Edwards, who raised Mitchell and his six siblings as a single mom, said she’s proud of the man and father he came to be.\n\n“To know that I have seven and knowing that he's a twin and I lost one, my heart is broken. And I know in time God is gonna heal it. But I am going to miss those phone calls. He would call me while he's on the way to work, ‘Mama, what you doing? And he's like, ‘Oh, look at this jerk driving’ to me, he’ll make those stupid comments like that. And I'm like, ‘Look baby, just be safe out there. Just take your time.’ He like ‘Mama I got this,’” she said with a chuckle.\n\n“I will never have another Jamal, he's irreplaceable.”\n\nOfficer Jamal Mitchell. Courtesy Minneapolis Police Department\n\nMitchell loved being a police officer. When he visited his mother and stepfather in Florida two months ago, they walked through downtown Disney together. Mitchell made sure to greet everyone, including anyone in uniform.\n\n“He would talk to people as you walk by, especially a police officer. First thing he said ‘Thank you for your service. Oh and by the way, let me tell you, I'm a police officer too.’ He’d let them know that he was a police officer and they would get to talk,” said Dennis Ray Edwards Sr., Mitchell’s stepfather.\n\nMitchell’s family is planning a service to commemorate Mitchell in his hometown in Connecticut. They said they will miss his “gentle spirit” tremendously.",

            "summary": "The Minnesota BCA has identified the two Minneapolis officers who were able to stop a gunman who killed a police officer last week during a shooting spree.\n\nOfficer Jamal Mitchell was killed as he tried to help two people he believed to be shooting victims along Blaisdell Avenue on Thursday afternoon. According to the BCA, Mitchell was the first officer on the scene after 911 calls came in for a shooting at an apartment building near Blaisdell and East 22nd Street.\n\nThe BCA says Mitchell reported over the radio that he saw two men injured in the street as he pulled up. Those two people turned out to be the gunman, Mustafa Mohamed, 35, and a bystander who had been shot. Mohamed was sitting next to a car as Officer Mitchell approached him, trying to see if he was injured. Without warning, the BCA says Mustafa pulled a gun and shot Officer Mitchell.\n\nSWAT teams respond after Officer Jamal Mitchell was killed in a shooting along Blaisdell Avenue on Thursday, May 30. (FOX 9)\n\nMuhamed kept firing at Mitchell until two other officers pulled up. Mohamed then took shots at the other officers. Those officers, identified Sunday as Nick Kapinos and Luke Kittock, were able to fire the shots that stopped Mohamed's rampage.\n\nMitchell was rushed to Hennepin County Medical Center where he was pronounced dead. Kittock was also struck by gunfire during the exchange with Mohamed. He was treated and released from the hospital.\n\nThe bystander, who Officer Mitchell was trying to help, was also seriously injured. A firefighter was also hurt during the chaos.\n\nAlong with those outside, police also found a body in the apartment building near the shooting scene on Blaisdell Avenue.\n\nMohamed was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nWho is Jamal Mitchell?\n\nJamal Mitchell had been with the Minneapolis Police Department since 2022, and was sworn in by Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara. In a late-night news conference, O'Hara remembered Mitchell fondly, saying, \"I knew Jamal. I had the distinct honor of swearing in Jamal as a Minneapolis police officer. Shortly after hitting the street, I commended and honored him for running into a burning house in the 5th Precinct to rescue an elderly couple. He loved the job, he loved the MPD, and he was faithful to the oath he swore unto his death.\"\n\nFOX 9 previously reported on Officer Mitchell's heroic actions in 2023 when, just days on the job, he ran into the burning home to rescue the couple.\n\nMitchell, who was 36, was engaged to be married and had a son.\n\n\"Jamal died a hero, and like police officers in Minneapolis standing behind me here and everywhere, he was one of the few who have the courage to stand up and answer the call every single day. He died doing what we asked him to do for the rest of us,\" O'Hara said. \"Jamal died doing what society asks all police officers to do. He did his job, and he was loyal to his oath until his death. There is no more honorable service one can provide.\"\n\nOfficer Mitchell's death marks the first line-of-duty death for Minneapolis police since 2002 when Officer Melissa Schmidt was killed. Officer Schmidt was also killed on Blaisdell Avenue while responding to a report of a woman with a gun at a public housing complex.\n\n",

We detected four today.”\n\nA drone study conducted by the lab and published last year found that across California, young white sharks swam very close to people without swimmers even noticing.\n\nAnd there is a lower probability of being bitten at a shark aggregation site than at a non-aggregation site, Lowe said.\n\n“Sharks are known to avoid people, but every once in a while, they make mistakes,” Lowe said. “It’s possible the shark involved this incident was literally just passing through and hadn’t had a chance to encounter people.”",

            "summary": "ATLANTA (AP) — Water pressure was returning to downtown Atlanta and nearby neighborhoods on Sunday after a two-day water outage shut down businesses and left faucets dry at many homes.\n\nA large swath of the city remained under an order to boil water before drinking it, but Mayor Andre Dickens said in a late Saturday news conference that one of the two major water main breaks affecting the city had been repaired.\n\nThe first-term Democratic mayor, who faces reelection in 2025, was again apologetic, even as residents continued to savage the city’s response. Among the critics: Megan Thee Stallion, whose Friday and Saturday night shows at downtown’s State Farm Arena were canceled.\n\n“Call the mayor! All day they’ve been telling us we can perform,” the rapper said in a video she posted Saturday.\n\nThe city said Dickens visited senior centers and other locations Sunday to check on water supplies, while the city continued to hand out bottled water at some fire stations. The outage did not affect the entire city of 500,000 — many areas in Atlanta’s northern and southern ends never lost water pressure and never faced a boil order.\n\nState Farm Arena management said Megan Thee Stallion’s Friday night show would take place on Sunday, while the Saturday show was rescheduled for Monday.\n\nOther events downtown happened on schedule Sunday, including an Atlanta United soccer match at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Centennial Olympic Park turned back on its fountains, where children often splash in bathing suits.\n\nTwo affected hospitals said they were still providing bottled water to patients, but said they were otherwise ramping back up to normal operations, with regular schedules of surgeries and appointments planned for Monday.\n\nDepartment of Watershed Management Commissioner Al Wiggins Jr. told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that boil orders could be lifted in some areas Monday.\n\nThe problems began Friday morning where three large water mains intersect just west of downtown. Wiggins said at a Saturday news conference that at least some of the pipes that burst were old and corroded. With pipes coming together in a confined area, it was a tight squeeze to make repairs, with only one worker at a time working in the manhole accessing the junction. Repairs were completed Saturday evening, officials said.\n\nAnother water main later burst in the city’s Midtown neighborhood, which is studded with new office, hotel and apartment towers. Wiggins said Saturday that officials weren’t sure yet why that pipe had broken. That leak continued to gush through the city streets Sunday. City officials said Saturday that they were working on ways to isolate the leak from the larger water system and were awaiting a part needed to repair to the pipe. Dickens declared a state of emergency so the city could buy materials and hire workers without following the normal purchasing laws.\n\nFaltering infrastructure is a common story in older parts of American cities. Atlanta has spent billions in recent years to upgrade its aging sewer and water infrastructure, including a tunnel drilled through 5 miles of rock to provide the city more than 30 days of stored water. Last month, voters approved continuing a 1-cent sales tax to pay for federally mandated sewer upgrades. The city at one time routinely dumped untreated sewage into creeks and the Chattahoochee River.\n\nCity workers spent much of Saturday handing out water and setting up portable toilets at several fire stations while checking on senior citizens who live in high-rise residences.\n\nOfficials were widely criticized for being slow to update citizens on the situation. The city and its water management department sent out an update after 8 p.m. Friday and waited more than 12 hours to update residents again. Dickens didn’t address the media until 2 p.m. Saturday, explaining he was in Memphis, Tennessee, when the problem began.\n\nSomeone in the affected area posted flyers around the neighborhood asking “Don’t have water?” and “Help us find our mayor.”\n\nSome attractions and businesses, including the Georgia Aquarium, reopened on Sunday, although the aquarium warned that the boil water order meant no ice or fountain drinks in its cafeteria.",

It is unfortunate that such a big, independent, powerful country as China is an instrument in the hands of Putin,” he said.\n\nSince a phone call between Zelenskiy and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, one year ago, Ukraine had sought meetings with Chinese officials at all levels, he said, but this had not been granted. He had not met Chinese officials despite their presence in Singapore.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, the Chinese defence minister, Dong Jun, told attendees of the Shangri-La Dialogue his country had “been promoting peace talks with a responsible attitude”. “We have never provided weapons to either party of the conflict. We have put stricter control on the export of dual use items and have never done anything to fan the flames. We stand firmly on the side of peace and dialogue,” Dong said.\n\nBut Zelenskiy said: “With China’s support to Russia, the war will last longer and that is bad for the whole world. You cannot say that we accept sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and at the same time be on the side of the country that violates the principles of the UN charter and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.”\n\nZelenskiy said on X he had met the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue on Sunday morning. “We discussed the key issues: the defence needs of our country, bolstering Ukraine’s air defence system, the F-16 coalition, and drafting of a bilateral security agreement,” he said.\n\nHe said he was grateful to Joe Biden for his decision to allow Ukraine to use US-supplied weapons against targets in Russia. However, in comments to media he said that this was not enough as Ukraine still did not have the systems or permissions to target airfields from which Russia was “permanently firing”.",

            "summary": "China says MI6 recruited Chinese couple as spies\n\nBeijing and several Western countries have increasingly been trading accusations of espionage\n\nChina has accused the UK’s intelligence agency of recruiting a couple as spies - the latest in a string of tit-for-tat allegations between Beijing and the West in recent months.\n\nAccording to China’s Ministry of State Security, the two state department employees were successfully recruited after MI6 operatives exploited the man’s “strong desire for money”.\n\nThe man, named as Wang, then convinced his partner, named only as Zhou, to join him as a British spy.\n\nThe accusations come weeks after the UK charged two men with spying for China.\n\nThe men were accused of giving \"articles, notes, documents or information\" to a foreign state, while China has called the allegations \"malicious slander\".\n\nEarlier this month, a former Royal Marine charged with assisting the Hong Kong intelligence service was found dead, said police.\n\nChina did not reveal how it uncovered the case involving Mr Wang and Ms Zhou, saying only that it came after a \"thorough investigation\".\n\nThe case is still under investigation and Chinese officials did not say if the couple would be charged.\n\nThe BBC has contacted the UK authorities for a response.\n\nChina’s Ministry of State Security alleged that MI6 started cultivating Mr Wang when he was studying in the UK under a Sino-British exchange programme in 2015.\n\nThe operatives took \"special care\" of him in the UK, such as inviting him to dinners and tours to better \"understand his interests and weaknesses\", the ministry alleged.\n\nThey befriended him on campus under the guise that they were alumnus, and got him to provide \"paid consulting services\".\n\nThrough Mr Wang the MI6 operatives also recruited Ms Zhou to spy for China, the country's Ministry of State Security claimed. They both had \"core confidential roles\" in an unnamed state agency, it added.\n\n\"Wang was initially hesitant but could not resist [the operatives'] repeated persuasion, enticement and even coercion, and eventually agreed,\" the ministry said in a statement on WeChat.\n\n\"Under Wang's strong instigation, Zhou agreed to collect intelligence... and he and his wife became British spies.\"\n\nIt is unclear why Beijing has chosen to publicise this case, says Chong Ja-Ian, a scholar at Carnegie China. It could be making the case public as a form of retaliation, but Beijing has also arrested people for espionage in the past.\n\nAnd without more information, it is difficult to ascertain the veracity of Beijing's claims, Dr Chong said.\n\n\"Sometimes these do not appear... The opacity of the [the Chinese Communist Party] including its judicial system, especially when it comes to espionage cases, can make understanding the details of the case especially challenging,\" he added.\n\nChina's Ministry of State Security has been posting frequent updates on its official channel since it was launched in August.\n\nIn January, it warned its citizens against \"exotic beauties\" seeking to lure them into the hands of foreign spy agencies.\n\nAmong other things, it has also cautioned citizens against photographing military equipment and warned against organisations \"recruiting aviation enthusiasts as volunteers\" to transmit China's flight data to other countries.",

            "summary": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nChina on Monday accused Britain of recruiting a married couple employed by the Chinese central government to spy for its MI6 intelligence service, as the two countries trade allegations of espionage.\n\nIn a statement, China’s civilian spy agency, the Ministry of State Security (MSS), said it had recently cracked a “major espionage case” involving MI6, in which it uncovered two important moles “planted by the British side within our ranks.”\n\nThe allegation comes just weeks after British police charged three people with spying for Hong Kong’s intelligence service, following charges laid in April against two other people accused of spying for China, including a former researcher for a prominent lawmaker in the ruling Conservative Party.\n\nThose charges in the United Kingdom came after China’s MSS said in January it had detained the head of a foreign consultancy who had allegedly spied for MI6.\n\nUnder Xi Jinping, China’s most authoritarian leader in decades, the country’s notoriously secretive spy agency has drastically raised its public profile and broadened its remit. From a shadowy organization without any discernable public face, the MSS has been transformed into a highly visible presence in public life.\n\nOver the last six months the MSS has made regular public declarations of dismantling foreign spying operations, claims which are impossible to verify given their nature but paint the agency in a positive light and provide regular reminders to Chinese citizens to be wary.\n\nIn its latest statement Monday, the MSS detailed its allegations against the married couple.\n\nIt said an alleged spy, identified by his surname Wang, was working at a position “with access to core confidential information” in an unnamed central state organ.\n\nIn 2015, Wang’s application to study in the UK under an exchange program was “swiftly approved” because MI6 valued his access, according to the MSS.\n\nWhile studying in Britain, Wang was allegedly invited to meals and tours arranged by MI6 to understand his “character weaknesses and personal interests,” MSS said.\n\nAfter finding out Wang had “a strong desire for money,” the British spy agency used an alumnus to lure him into a part-time consulting opportunity with high remuneration, MSS said.\n\n“The British side started with open research projects and gradually moved into core internal matters of our central state agencies, paying him a fee significantly higher than normal consulting rates. Although Wang was somewhat wary of this, he continued to provide so-called ‘consulting’ services to the British side under the lure of large sums of money,” the MSS statement said.\n\nAfter a while, MI6 personnel approached Wang to work for the British government with promises of higher monetary rewards and security guarantees, the MSS alleged.\n\nWang allegedly agreed to the terms and received espionage training before he was told to return to China to gather intelligence, the statement said.\n\nThe MSS claimed MI6 also repeatedly urged Wang to persuade his wife – who worked at a “core” government agency – to join the espionage, offering to double the money. Despite his initial hesitation, Wang and his wife, surnamed Zhou, eventually agreed, MSS alleged.\n\nThe case is under further investigation, according to MSS.\n\nCNN has asked for comment from Britain’s Foreign Office, which handles media enquiries for the Secret Intelligence Service, the official name for MI6.\n\nIn August last year, the MSS made its social media debut: it launched an official account on WeChat, China’s most popular social app, with a rallying call for “all members of society” to join its fight against foreign infiltration. Its posts regularly rack up hundreds of thousands of views and are widely shared by state media outlets.\n\nAccording to the MSS, foreign spies are omnipresent and infiltrating everything – from mapping apps to weather stations. The ministry has previously posted details of what it claims are espionage activities carried out by Western spy agencies, and detailed how Chinese nationals studying or working abroad have allegedly been recruited by the CIA.",

It said he applied for an exchange programme to Britain in 2015.\n\nBesides the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the United States, MI6 is the only other spy agency the MSS has publicly named. In other cases, it simply used the descriptions “some country” and a “foreign spy agency”.\n\nIt is the latest case announced by China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) amid a public campaign to counter espionage in the country, and the second involving MI6.\n\nChina’s top anti-espionage agency said it cracked a major espionage case involving a married Chinese couple who worked for the government while passing information to the British Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6.\n\nAccording to the MSS, after Wang reached Britain, MI6 arranged for staff to invite him to parties and set up tours. After determining he could be persuaded financially, MI6 sent operatives to befriend him on campus, telling him of high-reward part-time opportunities, the ministry said in its WeChat post.\n\nThe part-time research job started with public programmes but gradually involved core information from the Chinese government and the pay offered was several times that of a regular consultation fee, the MSS said, adding that even though Wang was alert to the possibility it was contrary to China’s interest, he kept offering “consultation services” , tempted by the high fee.\n\nChina’s anti-spy agency said that after a while, MI6 disclosed its identity to Wang and asked him to serve the British government, offering higher pay and security. They then trained Wang as a spy and sent him back to China to gather more intelligence, the MSS said.\n\nWang’s wife, surnamed Zhou, also worked for a core confidential government agency in China and MI6 offered to double its pay to involve Zhou as well, the ministry said, adding that after rounds of threats and persuasion, Zhou also agreed to collect intelligence for Britain.\n\nThe case was still under investigation, it said.\n\nIn January, the MSS disclosed a case involving MI6 for the first time. It said it had detained a foreigner who was in charge of a foreign consultancy and had been recruited by MI6 to gather information.\n\nIn the statement at the time, the ministry said MI6 had developed a “cooperative relationship for intelligence” with the person, surnamed Huang, since 2015, and provided training and spy equipment.\n\n01:30 Matthew Trickett, Briton accused of spying for Hong Kong, found dead in park Matthew Trickett, Briton accused of spying for Hong Kong, found dead in park\n\nPreviously, the ministry accused the CIA of being behind a handful of espionage cases, such as turning a worker in a Chinese state-run arms company to spy for them.\n\nIn recent months, the ministry has also sought to mobilise the Chinese public to report “suspicious” activities . In April, state news agency Xinhua reported that the MSS had recognised 86 representatives from the public for “maintaining national security”.\n\nThey had either sent tips or reported suspicious activities through the MSS hotline, website portal, WeChat or reported in person, and cooperated with the ministry in follow-up investigations, it said.",

            "summary": "Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and others see an opportunity, but it remains unclear who will be qualified to run by the Guardian Council.\n\nTehran, Iran – Iran’s ex-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and other divisive figures – such as moderate Ali Larijani and ultraconservative Saeed Jalili – have signed up to contest new elections after the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nAhmadinejad, who was president from 2005 to 2013, registered along with dozens of others at the interior ministry on Sunday, a day before the sign-up period ends.\n\nThe politician, who had been largely sidelined following his controversial terms in office, said he’s only heeding “a call from people from across the country” to run again, and he’s confident he can resolve Iran’s domestic and international issues.\n\n“Don’t ask political questions,” he said with a grin when asked by reporters about his reaction if he were to be disqualified from running by the Guardian Council – the constitutional body that vets all candidates.\n\nDespite Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urging him to stay away in 2017, he signed up and was barred from running, but chose to not register for the 2021 election.\n\nAhmadinejad’s presidency was marked by economic malaise defined by massive inflation and currency devaluation, along with explosive tensions over Iran’s nuclear programme – which saw multilateral sanctions imposed on the country.\n\nHis 2009 re-election sparked the Green Movement of protests across the country amid claims of vote tampering, which were refuted by authorities as they mounted a crackdown.\n\nWho else wants to be in the race?\n\nThe dozens who signed up to run for president also include senior security official and former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, former three-time parliament speaker Ali Larijani, Tehran’s Mayor Alireza Zakani, and former central bank chief Abdolnasser Hemmati.\n\nJalili is now the Iranian supreme leader’s representative to the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) and used to be security chief from 2007 to 2013 at the height of the tensions surrounding the nuclear file. He has run for president unsuccessfully three times before.\n\nLarijani, a conservative figure belonging to a powerful family, is perhaps the only relatively moderate candidate with any chance of garnering a considerable number of votes – that is if he is greenlit by the Guardian Council after being disqualified in 2021.\n\nDespite the disqualification last time, Larijani was the first major figure to announce his candidacy, signing up in Tehran on Friday with his campaign releasing a dramatic video containing cinematic shots of him in the process.\n\nAfter the latest presidential and parliamentary elections produced the lowest turnouts in the near 45-year history of the Republic of Iran, turnout is expected to prove a challenging issue during this vote as well.\n\nThe research centre of the Iranian parliament announced on Sunday that 53.4 percent of people – responding to a survey it conducted – said they would vote in the June 28 presidential election, with 28.9 percent still on the fence.\n\nThis is just above the 48 percent that saw Raisi become president, and much higher than the 42 percent turnout announced for the parliamentary election in March.\n\nThe Guardian Council is scheduled to begin vetting the candidates from Tuesday for six days, after which the list of approved candidates will be announced on June 11.",

He and other serious contenders against Raisi had been barred from running in the 2021 election.\n\nLarijani, 66, is viewed as a conservative within Iran’s narrow political scene. However, he has increasingly allied himself with former President Hassan Rouhani, whose administration reached a 2015 nuclear deal with a group of world powers. Larijani had positioned himself as a pragmatic candidate in the 2021 vote in which hard-liner Raisi, a protégé of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was elected.\n\nLarijani had posted online and made comments in recent days all but confirming he would be a candidate. The Larijani family has long been powerful in Iran’s Shiite theocracy.\n\n“Solving the issue of sanctions for an economic opening will be among the priorities of diplomacy” for Iran, Larijani told journalists.\n\nLater Friday, former Iranian Central Bank chief Abdolnasser Hemmati, who also ran in the 2021 presidential election, registered. Hemmati, 67, told journalists: “Today, I still hope for the future.”\n\n“Nothing is more important than the livelihood and welfare of the noble people of Iran,” he added.\n\nAll candidates must be approved by Iran’s 12-member Guardian Council, a panel of clerics and jurists ultimately overseen by Khamenei. That panel has never accepted a woman or anyone calling for radical change within the country’s governance.\n\nWho all will run — and potentially be accepted — remains in question. The country’s acting president, Mohammad Mokhber, a previously behind-the-scenes bureaucrat, could be a front runner because he has already been seen meeting with Khamenei. Also discussed as possible aspirants are former hard-line President Mohammad Ahmadinejad and former reformist President Mohammad Khatami, but whether they would be allowed to run is another question.\n\nThe five-day registration period will close on Tuesday. The Guardian Council is then expected to issue its final list of candidates within 10 days. That will allow for a shortened two-week campaign before the vote in late June.\n\nThe new president will take office while the country is enriching uranium at nearly weapons-grade levels and is hampering international inspections. Iran has armed Russia in its war on Ukraine and launched a drone and missile attack on Israel during the war in Gaza. It also has continued arming proxy groups in the Middle East such as Yemen’s Houthi rebels and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militia.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran’s economy has faced years of hardship over its collapsing rial currency. Widespread protests have swept the country, most recently over the death of Mahsa Amini, who died in police custody in September 2022 after being detained for allegedly violating Iran’s mandatory headscarf law. A U.N. panel said the Iranian government is responsible for the “physical violence” that led to Amini’s death.",

            "summary": "During AMD's Computex 2024 kick-off keynote, AMD's CEO, Dr. Lisa Su, officially unveiled and announced the company's next generation of Ryzen processors. Today marks the first unveiling of AMD's highly anticipated Zen 5 microarchitecture via the Ryzen 9000 series, which is set to bring several advancements over Zen 4 and the Ryzen 7000 series for desktop PCs, which will launch sometime in July 2024.\n\nAMD has unveiled four new chip SKUs using its Zen 5 microarchitecture. The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X processor will be the new consumer flagship part, featuring 16 CPU cores and a speedy 5.7 GHz maximum boost frequency. The other SKUs include, 6, 8, and 12 core parts, giving users a varied combination of core and thread counts. All four of these initial chips will be X-series chips, meaning they will have an unlocked multipliers and higher TDPs/clockspeeds.\n\nIn regards to performance, AMD is touting an average (geomean) IPC increase in desktop workloads for Zen 5 of 16%. And with the new desktop Ryzen chips' turbo clockspeeds remaining largely identical to their Ryzen 7000 predecessors, this should translate into similar performance expectations for the new chips.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 9000 series will also launch on the AM5 socket, which debuted with AMD's Ryzen 7000 series and marks AMD's commitment to socket/platform longevity. Along with the Ryzen 9000 series will come a pair of new high-performance chipsets: the X870E (Extreme) and the regular X870 chipsets. The fundamental features that vendors will integrate into their specific motherboards remain tight-lipped. Still, we do know that USB 4.0 ports are standard on the X870E/X870 boards, along with PCIe 5.0 for both PCIe graphics and NVMe storage, with higher AMD EXPO memory profile support expected than previous generations.\n\nAMD Ryzen 9000: Bringing Up to 16C/32T of Zen 5 to Desktop\n\nZen 5 is AMD's latest advancement in Ryzen microarchitecture. While AMD hasn't disclosed many technical details, we know some of the brand-new features that Zen 5 will offer.\n\nAMD Desktop CPU Generations AnandTech Ryzen 9000\n\n(Granite Ridge) Ryzen 7000\n\n(Raphael) Ryzen 5000\n\n(Vermeer) CPU Architecture Zen 5 Zen 4 Zen 3 CPU Cores Up to 16C / 32T Up To 16C / 32T Up To 16C / 32T GPU Architecture RDNA2 RDNA2 N/A GPU Cores 2 2 N/A Memory DDR5-5600 DDR5-5200 DDR4-3200 Platform AM5 AM5 AM4 CPU PCIe Lanes 24x PCIe 5.0 24x PCIe 5.0 24x PCIe 4.0 Manufacturing Process CCD: TSMC N4\n\nIOD:TSMC N6 CCD: TSMC N5\n\nIOD: TSMC N6 CCD: TSMC N7\n\nIOD: GloFo 12nm\n\nLooking at architectural differences between the last couple of generations (Zen 4 and Zen 3) and Zen 5, we know that AMD uses a new manufacturing process for its Ryzen 9000 desktop chips. While many have touted and speculated that Zen 5 for desktops will be built on one of TSMC's N3 (3 nm) nodes, some of our sources are saying that the Zen 5 CCD will be fabbed on TSMC N4 – though we are awaiting official confirmation about this (Update: And TSMC 4nm is now confirmed for the consumer Ryzen CCD). Furthermore, AMD's mobile counterpart offering, the Ryzen AI 300 series (Strix Point) has been confirmed for 4nm, and we've yet to see an AMD desktop CPU die produced on a more advanced node than its mobile counterpart.\n\nWhile AMD is not offering a deep dive into the Zen 5 architecture at Computex, the company did touch upon a few of the major architectural improvements over Zen 4 that will be coming with the new CPU architecture. These start with an improved branch predictor, which is designed to offer better accuracy, efficiency, and reduced overall latency of instruction cycles. The Zen 5 architecture also boasts higher throughput with wider pipelines and SIMDs, allowing for faster data processing and equating to better overall performance in benchmarks such as CineBench and Blender and workloads leveraging the AVX-512 instruction set.\n\nAdditionally, Zen 5 introduces a deeper out-of-order instruction window size across its design, enabling more parallelism and better handling of multiple instructions within the pipeline simultaneously.\n\nThere are also a couple of points within the Zen 5 architecture where AMD has doubled up on resources or performance. L2 to L1 memory bandwidth is one such example, giving the cache hierarchy a big bandwidth boost that should allow for faster data transfers within the individual CPU cores. AMD also claims better AI performance in inferencing and AVX-512 workloads. Notably, AMD's AVX-512 support on Zen 4 was executed using a 256-bit SIMD over 2 cycles, so this may be a sign that AMD has expanded their AVX-512 SIMDs to a full 512-bits wide in the Zen 5 architecture. (Update: This has since been confirmed by AMD. Zen 5 now has a full 512-bit wide SIMD for processing AVX-512 instructions)\n\nThese enhancements collectively aim to deliver significant performance gains over the previous Zen 4 microarchitecture, with AMD touting an average (geomean) 16% IPC uplift over Zen 4 in desktop workloads. It should be noted, however, that the top result in this benchmark collection is in the GeekBench 5.3 AES XTS benchmark, which leverages the VAES512 and VAES256 extensions of the AVX-512 instruction set. So AMD's AVX-512 SIMD changes greatly impact that benchmark in particular (though not exclusively).\n\nAbove is a render of a Ryzen 9000 series chip with two core complex dies (CCDs), which depicts the silicon's composition and layout. As with previous generations of Ryzen processors, there's a large central I/O die (IOD), through which all I/O and memory operations are routed. As for the CCDs, each die once again contains 8 CPU cores, with AMD equipping Ryzen chips with either 1 or 2 CCDs depending on the SKU. The new Zen 5 CCDs are being fabbed on one of TSMC's 4nm processes (AMD hasn't confirmed which flavor), which is a modest shrink from the N5 process used for Zen 4 CCDs.\n\nMeanwhile, although AMD hasn't confirmed that they're reusing the Ryzen 7000 series IOD here, all signs currently point to the Ryzen 9000 IOD being similar or identical to it. In particular, it is fabbed on the same TSMC N6 process, with the same 2 RDNA graphics CUs, and it offers the exact same off-chip I/O capabilities (though the latter is admittedly also dictated by the AM5 socket).\n\nAMD's Ryzen 9000 chips will also feature similar memory support as their predecessors, with AMD sticking to DDR5. However, AMD does note that the incoming X870E and X870 motherboard chipsets will allow for faster EXPO memory profiles than seen on Zen 4. As it stands, AMD hasn't disclosed the JEDEC memory specification of the four Ryzen 9000 SKUs that it announced today. However, we expect to find out more before the July 2024 launch of the Ryzen 9000 family. And according to AMD's product pages posted since the keynote, the Ryzen 9000 family will top out at JEDEC DDR5-5600 speeds for in-warranty configurations.\n\nAMD Ryzen 9000 Series Processors\n\nZen 5 Microarchitecture (Granite Ridge) AnandTech Cores /\n\nThreads Base\n\nFreq Turbo\n\nFreq L2\n\nCache L3\n\nCache TDP MSRP Ryzen 9 9950X 16C / 32T 4.3GHz 5.7GHz 16 MB 64 MB 170 W TBC Ryzen 9 9900X 12C / 24T 4.4GHz 5.6GHz 12 MB 64 MB 120 W TBC Ryzen 7 9700X 8C / 16T 3.8GHz 5.5GHz 8 MB 32 MB 65 W TBC Ryzen 5 9600X 6C / 12T 3.9GHz 5.4GHz 6 MB 32 MB 65 W TBC\n\nThe announcement of Zen 5 for desktop by AMD and the impending Ryzen 9000 offers four X-series SKUs at launch, allowing for overclocking and coming with unlocked CPU multipliers. The flagship SKU, the Ryzen 9 9950X, features 16 cores, a max boost clock of up to 5.7 GHz, 80 MB of cache split between 64 MB for the L3 and 16 MB for the L2 (1 MB per core of L2) and a 170 W TDP. The Ryzen 9 9900X offers 12 cores, a max boost clock of up to 5.6 GHz, 64 MB of L3 cache, and a 120 W TDP.\n\nMoving down the Ryzen 9000 stack is the Ryzen 7 9700X, which comes with 8 cores, a max boost clock of up to 5.5 GHz, 32 MB of L3 cache, and a 65W TDP. Finally, the entry-level SKU, the Ryzen 5 9600X, has just 6 cores, a max boost clock of up to 5.4 GHz, 32 MB of L3 cache, and a 65 W TDP.\n\nThe next slide denotes the flagship Zen 5 chip. The Ryzen 9 9950X is up against Intel's current 14th Gen Core i9-14900K. In productivity and content creation tasks, the Ryzen 9 9950X shows a 7% improvement in Procyon Office, a 10% increase in Puget Photoshop, and a 21% uplift in Cinebench R24 nT. More notably, it exhibits a 55% performance boost in Handbrake and a 56% increase in Blender.\n\nInterestingly, the gaming data shows marginal gains in some titles, although it highlights more significant uplifts in others. AMD's in-house testing shows that the Ryzen 9 9950X outperforms the Intel Core i9-14900K by 4% in Borderlands 3, 6% in Hitman 3, and 13% in Cyberpunk 2077. Further, it achieves a 16% improvement in F1 2023, a 17% gain in DOTA 2, and a 23% increase in Horizon Zero Dawn.\n\nAs we've mentioned, AMD is committed to extending its AM5 socket for longevity, at least much more than other vendors offer with their CPU launches and updates. As such, AMD's Ryzen 9000 series operates on the current AM5 platform. And while Ryzen 9000 is fully backwards compatible with existing 600 series boards, AMD has also readied two new 800 series motherboard chipsets for the launch of Zen 5 on desktops. The X870E (extreme) and X870 chipsets will be featured on numerous new motherboards at launch, and a big part of Computex this week will be the motherboard vendors (most of whom are local Taiwanese firms) showing off their new wares.\n\nAMD has offered just a handful of details about their X870E and X870 chipsets. Of particular note, USB 4.0 support is going to be standard on all X870(E) motherboards, whereas it was optional on X670(E) series boards. X870(E) boards will also feature Wi-Fi 7 support (up from 6E on the 600 series), and at least one PCIe 5.0 NVMe slot continues to be mandatory. AMD also notes that motherboards based on both platforms \"feature 44 total PCIe lanes,\" which would break down as 24 lanes from the CPU, and another 20 lanes coming from the chipset.\n\nAMD AM5 Chipset Comparison Feature X870E X870 X670E X670 B650E CPU PCIe (PCIe) 5.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 CPU PCIe (M.2 Slots) At Least 1 PCIe 5.0 Slot Total CPU PCIe Lanes 24 Chipset PCIe Lanes (Max) 4.0: 12\n\n3.0: 8 4.0: 8\n\n3.0: 4 4.0: 12\n\n3.0: 8 4.0: 8\n\n3.0: 4 USB4 Mandatory\n\n(Discrete, Consumes 4 Chipset PCie 4.0 Lanes) Optional SATA Ports (Max) 8 4 8 8 4 DDR5 Support Quad Channel (128-bit bus) Wi-Fi Wi-Fi 7 (Discrete) Wi-Fi 6E (Discrete) CPU Overclocking Support Yes Memory Overclocking Support Yes # of Chips 2 1 2 2 1 Silicon ASMedia Promontory 21 Available July 2024 July 2024 Sept. 2022 Sept. 2022 Oct. 2022\n\nFor the moment, different AMD resources are in conflict with each other about PCIe 5.0 – or, at least, aren't being very clear about it. According to AMD's AM5 chipset page, both X870 and X870E feature PCie 5.0 for both the CPU NVMe lanes and CPU PEG lanes. However AMD's Compute press release states that X870E is \"differentiated with 24 PCIe 5.0 lanes, with 16 lanes dedicated to graphics,\" implying that the vanilla X870 won't mandate PCIe 5.0 support. We're poking around AMD and the motherboard vendors to find out more.\n\nLooking under the hood, AMD has confirmed that the new chipsets aren't based on new silicon. Instead, the company is using the same ASMedia-produced design as in the X670/B650 chipsets: the Promontory 21 controller. Given that the feature sets of the newer X870E/X870 motherboards are fundamentally similar to those of the X670E/X670 motherboards, aside from using newer external controllers such as Wi-Fi 7, there's apparently little need to change the chipset itself. Though given the lack of significant changes, it does raise the question of why AMD has skipped a generation in its nomenclature (700-series anyone?) and went straight to the 800-series chipset.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 9000 series, including the flagship Ryzen 9 9950X (16C/32T), the Ryzen 9 9900X (12C/24T), the Ryzen 7 9700X (8C/16T), and the entry-level Ryzen 5 9600X (6C/12T) is expected to hit retail channels sometime in July 2024. At the time of writing, AMD is not providing pricing.",

            "title": "AMD’s first Zen 5 CPU is the ‘monster’ Ryzen 9 9950X",
            "summary": "AMD is launching its first Zen 5 desktop processors in July, with the Ryzen 9 9950X flagship leading the pack as “the world’s most powerful desktop consumer processor.” Based on AMD’s existing AM5 platform, the new Ryzen 9000 series of CPUs include the Ryzen 9 9950X, Ryzen 9 9900X, Ryzen 7 9700X, and Ryzen 5 9600X.\n\nThe flagship Ryzen 9 9950X is a 16-core, 32-thread CPU, with 80MB of L2+L3 cache and a 5.7GHz boost clock. AMD is promising around a 16 percent instructions per cycle (IPC) uplift in performance over the previous-generation Ryzen CPUs, with big promises of performance gains in productivity as well as gaming.\n\nThe Ryzen 9000 series lineup. Image: AMD\n\n“It’s a big leap, and we’re very very proud of it,” says Donny Woligroski, senior technical marketing manager for consumer processors at AMD, in a press briefing with The Verge. “It’s a monster. This processor does really well against the competition.”\n\nAMD is promising gains of up to 56 percent in Blender against Intel’s Core i9-14900K with the new flagship 9950X, and even 21 percent in Cinebench 2024. On the gaming side, AMD’s benchmarks show a 4 percent frame rate bump over the 14900K in games like Borderlands 3, all the way up to 23 percent better performance in Horizon Zero Dawn.\n\nAt the heart of the 9950X is AMD’s new Zen 5 architecture. It’s still using the AM5 socket, with the usual PCIe Gen 5 and DDR5 support, but there are some updates under the hood to deliver more performance that AMD argues make this not a trivial update. “Sometimes there are updates of Zen that are not as fundamental, but Zen 5 is a sweeping update with vastly improved branch prediction for both accuracy and latency,” says Woligroski. “It’s a really impressive difference, and this delivers up to twice the instruction bandwidth, up to twice the data bandwidth, and up to twice the AI performance of the last gen.”\n\nAMD’s IPC promise for the latest Zen 5 CPUs. Image: AMD\n\nAMD’s benchmark claims against the 14900K. Image: AMD\n\nAMD originally promised that the AM5 socket, which launched in 2022, would keep seeing new processor support until at least 2025, but it’s now extending that commitment at Computex to 2027 or beyond. The previous AM4 socket was introduced in 2016, and it’s still going strong today, almost a decade later. AMD is even launching new 5900XT and 5800XT processors for AM4 motherboards in July. The original 5900X was a 12-core processor, but the 5900XT is now a 16-core, 32-thread CPU, designed to take on Intel’s midrange 13th Gen desktop CPUs. The 5800XT has 8 cores, 16 threads, and a boost clock up to 4.8GHz.\n\nAMD’s commitment to AM4 and now AM5 is seriously impressive, especially compared to Intel, which is about to launch its fourth desktop socket since 2016. The upcoming LGA 1851 socket replaces LGA 1700, which debuted in 2021, replacing 2020’s LGA 1200, which replaces the LGA 1151 Intel used from 2015 to 2019.\n\nAMD’s new Ryzen 9 and Ryzen 7 CPUs for the AM4 socket. Image: AMD\n\n“This really speaks to the success of socket AM4 and previous-gen processors that are lasting so much longer than anyone thought a platform could,” says Woligroski. “It’s the real advantage of having a commitment from your CPU supplier that says we’re in this for the long haul — if you want to upgrade at some time, you don’t have to throw your system away and start from scratch.”\n\nWhile AM5 is being extended, AMD is also launching new X870 and X870E motherboard chipsets for these new Ryzen 9000 series CPUs. You don’t need these new boards for these new CPUs, but they do come with USB 4.0 as standard, and they all include PCIe 5 Gen 5 on the graphics and NVMe sides, even on the non-E X870 boards this time around. They also support higher EXPO memory overclock support, which is great for enthusiasts who want the best memory speeds possible.",

The probe is set to collect rock and soil samples from the surface that could provide valuable insights into how the lesser-explored far side of the moon compares to the near side.\n\nThe mission “involves many engineering innovations, high risks and great difficulty,” the China National Space Administration said in a statement. “The payloads carried by the Chang’e-6 lander will work as planned and carry out scientific exploration missions.”\n\nUsing a small robotic shovel and drill, the probe will collect about four pounds of surface material that will be launched into lunar orbit with a small rocket booster and picked up by an orbiting craft.\n\nNo other country has landed a probe on the far side of the moon, and the Chang’e-6 is China’s second. Missions to the far side of the moon are especially difficult because of communication challenges and its pockmark deep craters.\n\nThe probe launched early last month, with the mission expected to last about another month. Two other spacecraft have reached the moon so far this year, one Japanese and one from U.S. startup Intuitive Machines.\n\nChang’e-6 is the sixth moon exploration for China, as it heavily invests in space exploration. The country also operates its own crewed space station in rivalry with the International Space Station, and says it will place astronauts on the moon by 2030.\n\nThat mission would make it the second nation to place astronauts on the moon after the U.S. No person has set foot on the moon since 1972, though NASA has plans to go back in 2026 at the earliest.\n\nThe American-led Artemis missions are planned to rely on significant support from private space companies and are in partnership with the Canadian, European and Japanese space agencies.\n\nBoeing’s Starliner program, the company’s first step into private spaceflight, has faced repeated delays in attempts to launch its first craft this month.",

It also reduces the windows to communicate with the uncrewed craft.\n\nThe craft hovered about 300 feet above the moon's surface, scanning it with 3D technology before landing. Chinese space officials called the touchdown an \"historic moment.\"\n\nChang'e 6 will now begin a three-day exploration of the lunar surface, gathering material as part of a mission that the CNSA said would include \"many engineering innovations, high risks and great difficulty.\"\n\nMost prominently, the Chang'e 6 will seek to extract some of the oldest known rocks to exist on the lunar south pole.\n\nPernet-Fisher said the chance to analyze rocks and other objects from a completely different part of the moon could answer fundamental questions about how planets form.\n\nMost of the rocks collected so far are volcanic, similar to what we might find in Iceland or Hawaii, he said. But the material on the far side would have a different chemistry.\n\n\"It would help us answer those really big questions, like how are planets formed, why do crusts form, what is the origin of water in the solar system?\" Pernet-Fisher said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChina is the only country to have ever landed a module on the back side of the moon, having done so the first time with its Chang'e 4 spacecraft in 2019.",

Such \"additional players\" will be required to be available for interviews in a suitable, alternate location such as the interview room or hallway outside the locker room. There is no zoom requirement for the interviews with additional requested players outside of the press conference. • ALL players are required to remain in the building (whether requested or not) until all media obligations are met.\n\nThe Sky brought Chennedy Carter and Kamilla Cardoso to the podium along with coach Teresa Weatherspoon. There, Carter did not answer questions about the incident in the third quarter in which she put a shoulder into Clark, which was later upgraded to a Flagrant 1 foul upon league review Sunday.\n\nAs Reese was not at the podium, she was supposed to be available to in-person media outside the locker room.

One of those injured was a member of the group's advisory board, Michael Stürzenberger.\n\nInvestigators earlier said the suspect was an Afghan citizen who had been resident in Germany for around a decade. He had no criminal record and had not come to law enforcement's attention in the past, they said.\n\nThe suspect was eventually shot by police. As of Saturday evening, he was alive but in the hospital and in no fit state to be interrogated, according to investigators. As a result, they said, his motives and the reason for his attack required further investigation.\n\nPoliticians pay tribute, police union warns of 'daily' violence\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz said he was \"deeply dismayed\" to hear that the officer had died.\n\n\"His dedication to everyone's safety deserves the very highest respect,\" Scholz said.\n\nThe state premier of Baden Württemberg, where Mannheim is located, Winfried Kretschmann, said the news \"shocks me to the core,\" and offered condolences to the victim's family, friends and colleagues.\n\n\"This awful crime puts the often incalculable risks police officers are exposed to daily painfully before our eyes,\" Kretschmann said. \"We owe them the highest respect and reverence as a society.\"\n\nState Interior Minister Thomas Strobl said \"these are moments where the world seems to stand still.\"\n\n\"He gave his life because he stepped in to protect other people,\" Strobl said of the 29-year-old officer.

Police could be seen clashing with these protesters and encircling or \"kettling\" them, with law enforcement saying this was to stop them from attacking the far-right protesters.\n\n\"Around 15:15, a group of people, some obscuring their faces, tried to disturb the gathering at the market square and violently advance on them. Some of these people were armed with torches. The attack on the market square could be prevented by a swift police intervention.

(Elsa/Getty Images)\n\nSimone Biles has done it again.\n\nBiles won her ninth national all-around title on Sunday night to close out the U.S. gymnastics championships in Fort Worth, Texas. She won the gold medal on all four apparatuses and was nearly perfect throughout the entire competition as she gears up for a third Olympics run this summer in Paris.\n\nThe win in Texas officially clinched a spot for Biles in the U.S. Olympic Trials later this summer. She is now the first gymnast, man or woman, to win nine all-around national titles. Biles already owned that record after she broke a tie with Alfred Jochim for the record with her eighth win last year. That win also made her the oldest woman to ever win the title.\n\nSimone Biles wrapped up her historic 9th U.S. all-around title with this uneven bars routine. ⭐️#XfinityChamps pic.twitter.com/GaeWQ4qOME — NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) June 3, 2024\n\nSimone Biles is off and running on the final night. 👏#XfinityChamps | 📺 NBC & @peacock pic.twitter.com/97VpAX4FhQ — NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) June 2, 2024\n\nBiles finished with an all-around total score of 119.750.

            "title": "US gymnastics championships: Simone Biles wins record ninth national all-around title",
            "summary": "FORT WORTH, Texas – By the time Simone Biles rolled backwards onto the mat on her vault Sunday night, the error didn't even matter. Her lead at the 2024 U.S. championships was so massive, and her eponymous vault so difficult, that her victory was already all but assured.\n\nBiles won her record ninth all-around national title Sunday night, cruising to victory once again at Dickies Arena en route to what will surely be a third trip to the Olympic Games. Over two nights of competition, she recorded the highest score on all four events. And her all-around margin of victory – 5.9 points – was the gymnastics equivalent of a rout.\n\nBiles, 27, will now look ahead to the U.S. Olympic trials at the end of this month – the moment when she will learn who her four teammates on Team USA will be.\n\n\"I couldn't be more proud of how I'm doing at this time in the year,\" Biles said on NBC after her win. \"Just gaining that confidence over and over, getting myself back in front of a crowd and just doing what I do in practice.\"\n\nSkye Blakely, who finished second, was among several women who boosted their candidacies for Paris – displaying the combination of consistency and ability that the selection committee will be seeking as it assembles the 2024 Olympic team.\n\nSuni Lee, the reigning all-around Olympic champion, also had a strong showing – particularly on her two best events, uneven bars and balance beam. On Sunday, she improved her scores on those two apparatuses alone by nearly a full point from Friday's opening round. She finished fourth.\n\nKayla DiCello (third) and Jordan Chiles (fifth) rounded out the top five.\n\nHere's a recap of everything else you missed on the final night of the 2024 U.S. championships.\n\nSkye Blakely shines at home\n\nBlakely, 19, was perhaps the most impressive gymnast in the senior women's competition Friday night outside of Biles. And she finished just a quarter of a point off that all-around score on Sunday.\n\nBlakely received a thundering ovation when she stepped onto the podium alongside Biles at the end of the night, celebrating one of the biggest moments of her senior career to date in front of what amounts to a hometown crowd; Blakely resides in Frisco, Texas, just a short drive east of Dickies Arena in Fort Worth.\n\nSuni Lee comes up big on key events\n\nLee had a disappointing vault to start her Sunday night, sitting down on the landing after appearing to either trip or slip in the run up. But she didn't let it affect her − and thrived on her two most important events.\n\nThough Lee is the reigning all-around Olympic champion, it's her scores on balance beam and uneven bars that would be most valuable to Team USA in Paris. So it was a positive sign that Lee fared well on both events on both nights, finishing second only to Biles on beam and placing fourth on bars − even with a routine that is well short of her top-end difficulty.\n\nRecapping Jordan Chiles' night and wardrobe\n\nAfter rocking a Beyonce-inspired leotard on Friday night, Chiles arrived on the floor Sunday wearing a white Nike trenchcoat.\n\nA veteran of the 2021 Olympic team and close friend and training partner of Biles', Chiles improved slightly on the second night of competition, earning a silver medal on uneven bars and placing in the top-five on vault. She's hardly a lock to make the Paris team at this point, but she's put herself squarely in the mix.\n\nShilese Jones, Kaliya Lincoln will compete at Olympic trials\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − Moments after competition ended Sunday night, USA Gymnastics announced that it has approved the petitions by Shilese Jones and Kaliya Lincoln to compete at the U.S. Olympic trials later this month.\n\nJones, who has generally been the second-best U.S. all-arounder behind Simone Biles, withdrew from the U.S. championships with a shoulder injury. Kaliya Lincoln participated in the first two rotations Friday night before bowing out.\n\nThey are expected to join Biles, runner-up Skye Blakely and at least eight others at trials, which will take place in Minneapolis starting June 27. − Tom Schad\n\nSimone Biles wins every event, caps night with solid uneven bars routine\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − Winning a ninth U.S. title wasn’t enough for Simone Biles. She won every event, too.\n\nBiles capped her night with a solid routine on uneven bars, her “weakest” event. She flitted effortlessly between the bars and worked quickly going from one skill to the next. She was a little off-center on her upgraded dismount, a double-twisting, double somersault, and needed to take a step to secure herself. But that’s a minor blemish.\n\nShe scored a 14.4 and her combined total of 29.050 over the two nights put her in first place on the event ahead of Skye Blakely.\n\nThis is the second time Biles has swept all of the titles at nationals. She also did it in 2018. −Nancy Armour\n\nSimone Biles has commanding lead with one rotation to go\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − What Simone Biles does is so difficult, her scores are still well above anyone else’s even with an error.\n\nBiles overcooked her Yurchenko double pike, also known as the Biles II on vault, and rolled onto her back. She’d been landing them short in warmups and might have been trying to make sure she didn’t do that when it counted.\n\nNo matter. Biles scored a 15, more than a half-point better than anyone else so far Sunday night. Her second vault, a Cheng, was cleaner, with just a small step on the dismount.\n\nBiles has a commanding lead going into the final rotation, uneven bars. −Nancy Armour\n\nSuni Lee celebrates her 14.900 on beam\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − Several accomplished veterans have fallen on balance beam tonight, including Jade Carey, Jordan Chiles and Leanne Wong. But Suni Lee did not join them.\n\nLee brushed off a few minor wobbles to dramatically improve on her beam score from the first night, putting together a generally clean routine that left her pumping her fists in celebration. Her score of 14.900 was one tenth of a point higher than Simone Biles'.\n\n\"I don't want to overstate how big that beam routine was,\" NBC analyst John Roethlisberger said on air, adding that consistency on bars and beam will be the biggest key for Lee to make it to Paris. − Tom Schad\n\nSimone Biles steps out of bounds on floor but still in command\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − Simone Biles isn't perfect.\n\nBiles took a small step out of bounds on her first tumbling pass on floor exercise, a triple-twisting double somersault that's also known as the Biles II. Still, this is only the third time she's done her floor routine in competition this year, and it's looking more and more polished each time she does it. Her landings were cleaner and her smiles seemed to be coming more naturally as she did her dance moves. When she stepped into the corner, she looked directly at the camera and flashed a big grin.\n\nBiles' score was a 15.1, just 0.1 lower than it was Friday night. The deduction for stepping out on that first pass was the difference. Still, she's in firm control, and is two more routines from her ninth U.S. title, which would extend her own record. −Nancy Armour\n\nShilese Jones is sitting out nationals, but injury is improving\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − Shilese Jones, who has generally been the second-best all-arounder behind Simone Biles, isn't competing this week because of a shoulder injury. But she was nevertheless in the house Sunday to cheer everyone else on, and she indicated that her shoulder is improving.\n\n\"There's been a little bit of progress for today,\" Jones said in a televised interview on NBC. \"I woke up and it's feeling a little bit better than this whole week. It's been a little bit stiff, but some progression today.\"\n\nAsked about what it's like to take in the national championships from the stands, Jones said she's still nervous.\n\n\"I'm shaking for literally everyone,\" she said. \"I'm like, I know they got it, but the nerves are definitely still there.\" − Tom Schad\n\nSuni Lee looks relieved after scoring 14.500 on uneven bars\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − Suni Lee was practicing handstands in the entryway of an arena tunnel until moments before her turn on uneven bars, looking a bit unsettled after her disappointing vault. Perhaps noticing that, Simone Biles walked from the other side of the floor to give Lee some words of encouragement. \"You got this!\" Biles yelled as Lee started her routine.\n\nLee proceeded to notch a score of 14.500 in what is one of her signature events − two-tenths higher than what she scored on Friday night. She appeared visibly relieved after her dismount, smiling as she shared a hug with coach Jess Graba. − Tom Schad\n\nSuni Lee takes substantial deduction on vault\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − Suni Lee's night got off to an inauspicious start. The reigning Olympic all-around champion appeared to slip on her vault and then sat down during her landing, resulting in a substantial deduction.\n\nLee ultimately received a score of 12.150, which was nearly two full points lower than the 14.000 she received on the first night. She then left the floor briefly before returning with Simone Biles, who gave her a hug before they returned to their separate apparatuses. −Tom Schad\n\nSimone Biles starts Night 2 strong on beam\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − Gymnastics is hard. Not that you would realize that from watching Simone Biles.\n\nBiles opened the second night of competition at the U.S. championships on balance beam Sunday night, and she ticked off one big skill after another. The beam is just 4 inches wide and is 4 feet in the air, but Biles looked as if she was standing on flat ground.\n\nThe only bobble was a hop forward on her dismount, but it hardly mattered. She scored a 14.8, the same score she got on Friday night when she had the highest mark of the meet on the event. –– Nancy Armour\n\nNBC viewers won't see Simone Biles' first rotation live\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − Tonight's competition is being streamed live on Peacock and NBC... well, mostly anyways.\n\nWhile the first rotation began at 6:45 p.m. ET, the television coverage wasn't scheduled to begin until 15 minutes later − meaning American television viewers missed out on seeing Simone Biles' routine on balance beam as it happened. They also missed the first performances of the night from Suni Lee (vault), Jordan Chiles (balance beam) and Kayla DiCello (floor exercise), among others. − Tom Schad\n\nWhen does Simone Biles compete at the U.S. gymnastics championships?\n\nSimone Biles will compete in Session 2.

But the announcement of Gabby Douglas’ withdrawing was not a surprise after Douglas' rough outings in her first two competitions since the Rio Olympics in 2016. She fell twice on uneven bars, her signature event, at the American Classic on April 27. She looked better in training ahead of the U.S. Classic on May 18, but scratched after one event after again falling twice on bars. –– Nancy Armour\n\nKaliya Lincoln scratches from second night of nationals\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − Kaliya Lincoln has scratched from the second night of competition after departing early Friday night. USA Gymnastics said in a social media post that she has already petitioned for an invitation to the Olympic trials later this month.\n\nLincoln, 18, earned a a 12.700 on uneven bars and 12.300 on balance beam Friday before withdrawing. Her strongest event is floor exercise, where she finished second only to Simone Biles at last year's national championships. − Tom Schad\n\nWhat's at stake at the U.S. gymnastics championships\n\nBecause this weekend's event is the last one before the U.S. Olympic gymnastics trials, it is an important showcase for everyone who is hoping to book a ticket to the 2024 Paris Games.\n\nOn the women's side, the top two all-around finishers at the U.S. championships will automatically earn a spot at the Olympic trials, where they will be joined by a minimum of 10 other athletes invited at the discretion of USA Gymnastics. Of the 12 or more who compete at the Olympic trials, only five will make Team USA, not including alternates. – Tom Schad\n\nWhen are the U.S. Gymnastics Olympic Trials?\n\nJune 27-30 in Minneapolis.\n\nHow did Simone Biles do on Night 1\n\nBiles recorded her best all-around score of this Olympic cycle to date: 60.450. It’s the first time Biles has scored above 60 since 2021.\n\n\"That was a goal of hers. Very happy with her routines, attitudes — everything was really good,\" said Cecile Landi, who coaches Biles along with husband Laurent.\n\nHow to see live results from the U.S. gymnastics championships\n\nUSA Gymnastics will be providing live results of the women's competition, including Biles' pursuit of a ninth all-around national championship, on its website here. –– Tom Schad\n\nMessage from Gabby\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − Gabby Douglas is cheering on her would-be competitors Sunday night.\n\nThe three-time Olympic gold medalist took to Instagram earlier in the day to thank fans for their support during her comeback, and send good vibes to the gymnasts at the U.S. championships. Douglas had hoped to be among them, but she announced her withdrawal Wednesday and said in her Instagram post that she’d hurt her foot during training.\n\n“this may be the end of this chapter but not the end of my gymnastics story,” Douglas, the all-around champion at the 2012 Olympics in London, wrote. “thank you all for being with me on this journey and lifting me up on my lowest days i love you all so much!\n\n“sending all the best to the girls tonight! always cheering usa on!” –– Nancy Armour\n\nTrinity Thomas scratches for Night 2\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − Trinity Thomas, who returned to elite-level gymnastics this year after her final season at Florida, scratched the last three events on the first night of competition Friday after crashing twice on floor exercise.

            "summary": "FORT WORTH — Winning a national title is not supposed to look this easy. And it’s not normal for the same gymnast to stand atop the podium time and time again for more than a decade. But this is Simone Biles, and for her, the extraordinary is routine. The pressure of an Olympic year and the otherworldly expectations that follow Biles everywhere haven’t rattled her. She cruised through the national championships as she so often has, winning her ninth U.S. all-around title Sunday night in a testament to her longevity and excellence.\n\n“I use the phrase ‘aging like fine wine,’ ” Biles said. “... It’s just getting better and better. We’ll see. Hopefully we get to ride this out for the rest of the year.”\n\nOne successful routine at a time, Biles proved she might be better than she has ever been. The 27-year-old’s all-around score of 119.750 was nearly six points ahead of runner-up Skye Blakely’s 113.850. Biles also won the gold medals on all four apparatuses, each one a reminder of how she’s poised to rack up more gold in Paris this summer despite the trouble she had in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiles makes the world’s most difficult routines appear effortless because of how she performs them so consistently without errors. Her only mistake during this two-day competition came Sunday night, when she rolled backward out of her difficult Yurchenko double pike vault, a one-point deduction and her only fall this season. Otherwise, she was fantastic.\n\nSkip to end of carousel Build your own U.S. Olympic gymnastics team Choosing an Olympic gymnastics team is a complicated puzzle. Try to select your own gymnasts and see how your team performs. End of carousel\n\nBiles didn’t come back after Tokyo with simpler, safer routines. She came back better.\n\nThis is all about Biles competing against herself. That’s how it has to be when you have long been the best gymnast in the world and you could win the national title while making several major errors. After the U.S. Classic last month, Biles asked Coach Cecile Landi whether she had broken the 60.000 benchmark in the all-around, which no woman had done during this Olympic cycle. Biles fell just short with a 59.500. Taking that leap became her goal, even with the quick turnaround between her season debut and the national championships. She soared past that mark with a 60.450 on the first night of the women’s competition here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLandi admitted that Friday was perhaps Biles’s best outing but quickly added: “It’s not even the skills. It’s the attitude and her behavior. I really feel like she’s happy to be here. I know she says she’s ready to be done, but I think she’s really enjoying it and appreciating every meet she gets to do.”\n\nOn Sunday, the fall on vault brought down her all-around score, but on the other apparatuses Biles repeated her strong routines from two days earlier.\n\nHer unflappable performances are a product of her work in and out of the gym. Biles has harped on her commitment to therapy and how that effort has steadied her over the past year. As she rotates around the arena, with one dominant performance after another, she’s unfazed by the roars and squeals that accompany her every move.\n\n“It took a lot mentally and physically to trust my gymnastics again and most importantly trust myself,” she said. “I think that was the hardest part after Tokyo — I didn’t trust myself to do gymnastics.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now she’s back to routines just as difficult as the ones she performed in the lead-up to the Tokyo Games.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nBiles’s floor performance is a highlight of any competition she enters. She opened by launching herself into the air, flipping twice and completing three full twists. It’s one of the hardest skills in women’s gymnastics, and Biles landed perfectly upright, with a step out of bounds just a minor mistake. Altogether, she tallied a 7.1 difficulty score, which means her maximum score is a 17.100, while many others are thrilled to earn around a 14.000. When the world’s best gymnasts performed in the floor final at last year’s world championships, the non-Biles competitors averaged a difficulty score of 5.6.\n\nThose complex routines are why Biles always holds such an advantage, and the scores show she’s on a different level. Biles notched a 15.200 and 15.100 on floor here, while only two others reached 14.000. When she lands her Yurchenko double pike, she has a similar-size edge on that event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome gymnasts view the season as a months-long progression toward their best performances. Not Biles. Sure, Landi sees ways Biles can improve — elevating her artistry on floor, hitting her handstands more precisely on bars and consistently connecting her leap series on beam — but this weekend’s version of Biles, two months out from Paris, would take the Olympic all-around title easily. This has long been Biles’s winning formula. She doesn’t ease in to anything. She is excellent at one meet after another, year after year.\n\n“She needs to feel confident, and this is how she feels confident — competing well,” Landi said. “It builds up for her, and this is how it works.”\n\nBiles will perform twice more at the Olympic trials, and then it’s on to Paris, where she is in line to face pressure and attention unlike anything she has experienced since Tokyo. The clips of Biles flailing through the air during her botched vault, exiting the Olympic arena and then watching from the sideline will return to the forefront. Nothing she experiences over the next two months can match the stress that Paris will bring, but each strong performance offers reassurance before the final, ultimate test.",

            "summary": "EDMONTON, Alberta — The Dallas Stars needed another road win in Edmonton to keep their season alive and send the Western Conference finals back to American Airlines Center.\n\nDespite a dominant effort in 5-on-5 by the Stars, two power-play goals by the Edmonton Oilers in the first period gave them a sizable lead and were enough to secure the 2-1 win in Game 6 and the 4-2 series win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMason Marchment scored on an assist from Tyler Seguin midway through the third period, but Dallas couldn’t find the game-tying goal later in the period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Stars’ season ends in Game 6 of the conference finals for the second consecutive year.

SIGN UP Or with: Google Facebook By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nHere are five thoughts from the Stars’ season-ending loss:\n\nUnable to overcome the hump\n\nAt many times in the 2024 season, it felt as if the Stars had all the pieces to win the Stanley Cup.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey had depth with four scoring lines, strong goaltending in Jake Oettinger, the balance of veteran leadership and young talent and a coach with ample playoff experience to lead his team to a Stanley Cup Final.\n\nDespite winning the Western Conference regular-season title and finishing just one point behind the league leader, the season ended at the same point it did in 2023 — a Game 6 defeat in the third round.\n\nThe Stars have reached the conference finals seven times since the team moved to Dallas in 1993 but have reached the Stanley Cup Final only three times and won once.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“These teams that lose in these moments, you see them over time: the Vegases, the Floridas, Tampas,” Seguin said. “Unfortunately, you’ve got to lose a lot to win in this league. I don’t know why it’s like that, but learn some lessons, keep this taste, and get ready for next year.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDallas has not played in a Stanley Cup Final in Dallas this century. Its 2020 Final run was in the NHL bubble in Edmonton.\n\nUnlike last year, the Stars held a 2-1 series lead over Edmonton and a 2-0 lead in Game 4 before the Oilers outscored the Stars 10-2 to close out the series, winning three straight.\n\nStars coach Pete DeBoer has now lost his last five conference final series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpecial teams story of the series\n\nFacing the best power play and penalty kill in the playoffs, the Stars knew special teams would factor into the series.\n\nThrough four games it barely did, but once the Oilers’ power play got going, it completely changed the series. Dallas was never able to respond with its power play.\n\nThe Stars went 0-for-14 on the power play in six games this series against the Oilers. Two of those were in the first period of Game 6 when the Stars had a chance to answer Edmonton’s two early power-play goals. The Stars had another chance early in the third period but couldn’t score.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the last two games of the series, the Oilers went 4-for-5 on the power play, including 2-for-2 Sunday night.\n\nPenalties on Chris Tanev and Ryan Suter in the first period allowed Connor McDavid and Zach Hyman to give their team the lead. Edmonton finished 4-for-11 on the power play in the series.\n\nThose two goals were all the Oilers needed.\n\nStars can’t capitalize on 5-on-5\n\nOutside of special teams, the Stars were the better team Sunday night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDallas started hot, holding a 12-3 shot advantage through the first 20 minutes of play, but thanks to the power play, Edmonton held a 2-0 lead.\n\nThe Stars continued to dominate 5-on-5 play as the game progressed, finishing with a 35-to-10 shot advantage and 11-to-7 advantage in high-danger scoring chances.\n\nTen shots on goal ties for the fewest ever in a playoff win.\n\nDallas had its chances to score. It resolved an issue of not getting enough shots on net, as seen in Games 4 and 5 of the series. Still, the Stars couldn’t turn those shots into enough goals — a different issue they faced earlier in the playoffs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“You could probably argue that was our best game of the series,” Stars captain Jamie Benn said. “I feel like we probably deserved a better result there. But it’s hockey. They got one more goal than we did.”\n\nThe best player in the world looked the part\n\nThe Stars knew locking down Connor McDavid would be the biggest challenge of the playoffs yet.\n\nThey had contained Jack Eichel and Nathan MacKinnon in the first two rounds of the playoffs, but McDavid proved to be a different challenge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis impact was summed up in a single play just 4:17 into the game. The Oilers captain single-handedly weaved through Dallas’ penalty kill, dodging Sam Steel, Miro Heiskanen and Jake Oettinger to put his team up 1-0 on a stunning goal. A little over 10 minutes later, he had the primary assist on another power-play goal.\n\nMcDavid had 11 points (three goals and eight assists) in six games against the Stars. Dallas kept him off the board only one night, in the 3-1 Game 2 victory.\n\n“They’re a really good team,” Stars forward Wyatt Johnston said. “We always have confidence, and we believe that we can beat them, but they are a good team. They played well. They have some unbelievable players.”\n\nCONNOR MCDAVID WITH A DISGUSTING GOAL TO START GAME 6 🤯🔥 pic.twitter.com/f68uNrurVk — B/R Open Ice (@BR_OpenIce) June 3, 2024\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOilers’ goaltending the unexpected nail in coffin\n\nThe Stars had the goaltending advantage entering the Western Conference final.\n\nOilers starting netminder Stuart Skinner posted a .881 save percentage and 2.87 goals-against average in his first 10 playoff starts. Meanwhile, Jake Oettinger had stellar numbers in the first two rounds — a .918 save percentage and 2.09 goals-against average in 13 games.\n\nBut in a critical Game 6 with a Stanley Cup Final berth on the line, Skinner was the difference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Edmonton goalie made 34 saves in the series-clincher on home ice. He was tested early and often and responded, even when Dallas had dangerous opportunities to chip away at the Oilers’ lead.\n\nThe only goal he allowed was one he had no chance at with Marchment wide open in front of the net.\n\nOettinger prefers to face consistent shots, and he didn’t get that Sunday. Edmonton had just 10 shots on goal. While the goals weren’t necessarily his fault, Oettinger allowed two goals on just three first-period shots.\n\nGoaltending was an advantage the Stars needed to capitalize on in the series. Once they were finally able to get to Skinner, he was on his best game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn X/Twitter: @Lassimak\n\nFind more Stars coverage from The Dallas Morning News here.",

The NHL Draft in Las Vegas is scheduled for Friday, June 28 later that week.\n\nHow each team got here\n\nThe Oilers entered the playoffs with a 49-27-6 record, second in the Pacific Division. They beat the Los Angeles Kings in five games, before defeating the Vancouver Canucks in seven games. In the Western Conference final against the Stars, the Oilers rattled off three straight wins to take the series in six games.\n\nThe Panthers won the Atlantic Division with a 52-24-6 record. Last year’s Stanley Cup Final participants knocked off the Tampa Bay Lightning in five games, the Boston Bruins in six games before conquering the New York Rangers in the Eastern Conference final in six games.\n\nWhat’s at stake\n\nFor the Oilers, this is their first Stanley Cup Final appearance since 2006. A Stanley Cup would be Edmonton’s sixth in franchise history.\n\nThe Panthers are searching for the franchise’s first ever Stanley Cup win. Last season, Florida made the Stanley Cup Final before losing to the Vegas Golden Knights in five games.\n\nSeason series recap\n\nThe Panthers won both of their games against the Oilers this season, first winning 5-3 on Nov. 20 and then later scoring five goals again on Dec. 16 in a 5-1 drubbing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKey storylines\n\nA Canadian team hasn’t won a Stanley Cup since 1993 (the Montreal Canadiens). Several Canadian teams advanced to the Stanley Cup Final since 1993: the Calgary Flames (2004), the Oilers (2006), the Ottawa Senators (2007), Vancouver Canucks (2011) and the Canadiens (2021). All four of them lost in the final series.\n\nAnother major storyline is Connor McDavid. The No. 1 pick in the 2015 NHL Draft, McDavid won several individual awards, including the Hart Trophy three times, the Art Ross Trophy five times and the Ted Lindsay Award four times. The one item missing from his illustrious resume is a Stanley Cup.\n\nFor Florida, a Stanley Cup would be the franchise’s first. The Panthers reached the finals in 2023 for the second time in team history and a title in 2024 would be a sweet ending for an organization that has notched winning seasons in nine of the past 10 years.\n\nBefore 2014-15, Florida only tallied more than 35 wins in a season six times in team history.\n\nRequired reading\n\n(Photo: Patrick Smith / Getty Images)",

            "summary": "The 2024 NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs continue on Sunday with Game 6 of the Western Conference Finals between the Edmonton Oilers and the Dallas Stars. Edmonton owns a 3-2 series lead and will have a chance to close out the series in front of its home fans for its first trip to the Stanley Cup Final since 2006. However, the Oilers will have a plucky Stars squad on their hands that has already eliminated the last two Stanley Cup champions this postseason, beating the Vegas Golden Knights in seven games in the first round before besting the Colorado Avalanche 4-2 in the Western Conference semifinals.\n\nFaceoff is scheduled for 8 p.m. ET at Rogers Place in Edmonton, where these two teams split Games 3 and 4.

Higher oil prices would also allow fellow OPEC+ member Russia to maintain economic growth and stability as it spends heavily on its war against Ukraine.\n\nAnalysts say the cuts could push oil prices higher in coming months, and will be heavily watched going into the November election.

Brent traded near $81 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate was close to $77.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. said the OPEC+ decision was bearish given a recent increase in inventories, but UBS Group AG and RBC Capital Markets LLC expressed confidence the alliance will continue to diligently manage the market. Most analysts had expected OPEC+ to extend the curbs through to the end of the year.\n\nRead More: OPEC+ Extends Cuts But Lays Out Plan to Bring Barrels Back\n\nThe agreement aims to keep supporting oil prices while easing the production restraints against which some members — such as the United Arab Emirates — have chafed as they sought to have their output levels upgraded.\n\n“We have seen a rather muted price response so far,” and while moderating cuts from October may weigh on the market, demand is still likely to pick up over the coming months, said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S. “We view the $75-dollar level in Brent as a major line in the sand below which OPEC+ would likely step up their efforts to support prices.”\n\nTrading volumes were higher than usual on Monday, but oil option skews are still signaling bearishness. So-called puts — which profit from lower prices — remain at a wide premium over the opposite calls.\n\nOil capped a monthly loss on Friday in part due to persistent concerns around the demand outlook for China, the world’s biggest crude importer. The prompt spread for Brent briefly slipped into a bearish contango structure last week, and fuel markets have been flashing signs of weakness.\n\nFutures are still higher this year after geopolitical tensions from the Middle East to Ukraine raised concerns about supply.

They accused McManus of grinding against them while serving the team on an international flight to London. They also alleged the Jaguars failed to supervise McManus and create a safe environment for staff on the flight, per the lawsuit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcManus signed a one-year, $3.6 million deal with Washington in March that included a $1.5 million signing bonus. It’s unclear if Washington will seek to recoup any of the money or cancel any remaining payments.\n\n“Brandon would like to thank the Washington Commanders for the opportunity to be a part of the organization,” McManus’ attorney Brett Gallaway said on behalf of the kicker. “However, we reiterate that the allegations against Brandon are and remain absolutely false and importantly, are contradicted by indisputable evidence and the accusers’ own prior inconsistent statements and omissions.\n\n“While we are disappointed with the team’s decision to release Brandon before he had the opportunity to defend against these fabricated claims, we will aggressively defend and clear Brandon’s name and reputation through the legal process.

Coach Dan Quinn will address the McManus decision with the media on Wednesday.\n\nThe two women who filed the suit worked as flight attendants on the Jaguars’ Sept. 28, 2023, charter flight to London and alleged that McManus passed out $100 bills to encourage three flight attendants — not including Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe II — to drink and dance for him.\n\nJane Doe I alleged McManus tried to kiss her while she was seated during turbulence. Jane Doe I also alleged McManus grabbed her by the waist from behind and grinded on her on two separate instances while she served meals on the flight, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJane Doe II alleged in the lawsuit that McManus approached her from behind, grabbed her waist and grinded on her while she served the second meal on the flight to London. When the woman confronted McManus, he “simply smirked and walked away,” the lawsuit said. On the team’s return flight to Jacksonville, Jane Doe II remained in the aircraft’s second story to avoid McManus, per the suit.\n\nJacksonville played back-to-back London games in the 2023 season. The team hosted the Atlanta Falcons at Wembley Stadium on Oct. 1 before facing the Buffalo Bills at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Oct. 8.\n\nMcManus, 32, spent one season with the Jaguars after the Denver Broncos released him following nine seasons.

            "summary": "West Virginia’s starting pitcher failed to record an out and the Mountaineers went the final four innings without scoring Sunday night against Grand Canyon at Hi Corbett Field in Tucson, Arizona.\n\nNeither prevented the Mountaineers from reaching heights they never before have.\n\nWest Virginia scored early and often to play from in front from the second inning on and got strong relief outings from three pitchers in a 10-6 victory over Grand Canyon to lock up the Tucson Regional.\n\nThe result qualifies West Virginia (36-22) for a super regional — the program’s first appearance on that stage. WVU’s opponent in a best-of-three series will be determined Monday by the winner of North Carolina-LSU, though the Mountaineers are assured of being away from home regardless of which team advances. Super regional play begins Friday or Saturday for each of the eight series.\n\nIt also prolongs the career of WVU head coach Randy Mazey, who is retiring at the end of the season.\n\n“I’ve been to super regionals, but look at those kids out there. They’re the ones that haven’t had a chance to experience this and I’m just so happy for them,” Mazey said during a postgame interview on ESPN+. “This is the farthest that West Virginia baseball has ever gone and I couldn’t be more proud.”\n\nTwo days after throwing a complete game shutout and allowing four hits in a win against Dallas Baptist to help set the pace in West Virginia’s postseason, left-handed pitcher Derek Clark replaced Maxx Yehl after Yehl surrendered a two-run home run to Zach Yorke and then a single to Elijah Buries with one out in the ninth inning.\n\nThe Lopes greeted Clark with a single from Dustin Crenshaw but never got the tying run to the plate as Clark added to his memorable season by striking out Eli Paton and Beau Anekeney, who was caught looking on a 3-2 pitch for the final out.\n\nAfter prolonging its season earlier Sunday with a 12-10 win over Dallas Baptist, Grand Canyon was playing for the fourth time in 48 hours, and fell behind early when the Mountaineers got a sacrifice fly from Reed Chumley and a run-scoring single from Grant Hussey to lead 2-0, though WVU left the bases loaded.\n\nMountaineer staring pitcher Hayden Cooper allowed consecutive doubles to start his brief outing, including one from Cade Verdusco. Cooper failed to retire any of the five batters he faced and after he issues a bases loaded walk to Michael Diaz, Cooper was replaced by Aidan Major, who threw 60 of his 61 innings this season before May.\n\nBut Major limited the damage, inducing a sacrifice fly from Crenshaw that left the Lopes with a 3-2 lead, though that was all the offense they could muster.\n\nFive straight singles to start the top of the second allowed West Virginia to lead for good. Logan Sauve, Sam White and Chumley each drove in a run with their hit, enabling the Mountaineers to lead 5-3.\n\nThe advantage grew to five runs when Sauve continued his stellar swings in the regional — this time with a two-run double in the third that left GCU trailing, 8-3.\n\nBen Lumsden’s fourth-inning single upped the lead to 9-3, and Major allowed only one baserunner — on a walk — over the third and fourth frames.\n\nWhite’s run-scoring double in the top of the fifth and Hussey’s run-scoring single left WVU with a 10-3 lead, though Hussey was removed from the game after appearing to tweak a hamstring on the bases.\n\nDiaz connected for a run-scoring single in the bottom of the fifth — the Lopes’ first damage against Major, who was removed for Carson Estridge with two on and two outs later that frame.\n\nEstridge, who recorded the final out with the bases loaded to preserve WVU’s 5-2 win against GCU on Saturday, struck out Emilio Barreras to keep the Mountaineers’ lead at six runs through five.\n\nEstridge cruised through the sixth and benefitted from strong defense in the seventh. Left fielder Skylar King threw out Yorke at the plate after he’d attempted to score from second on a Paton single. It marked the final out of the frame and prevented the Lopes from drawing closer than six.\n\nEstridge was again stellar in the eighth and benefitted from more strong defense with shortstop JJ Wetherholt making a high-level play to take a hit away from Barreras.\n\nThat allowed Estridge to retire the side in order that inning, and he got another out to start the ninth, before Eddy Pelc singled.\n\nMazey then called on Yehl, but was forced to go to Clark two batters later. As he’s done throughout his first season at West Virginia, Clark delivered again, ensuring Mazey of at least two more games.\n\n“I’m having a lot of fun,” Mazey said as the Mountaineers celebrated their win singing along to Country Roads. “This is my favorite song, because they only play it after we win. This is a special tradition at West Virginia in all sports. Just look at that. That’s amazing.”\n\nMajor picked up the win by allowing one run on two hits over 4 2/3 innings. He struck out two and walked five.\n\nEstridge allowed one run on three hits in 3 2/3 innings. He struck out four and did not issue a walk.\n\nWetherholt and Sauve had three hits apiece and Sauve drove in three runs.\n\nWhite, Chumley and Hussey drove in two runs apiece, with WVU’s No. 2-5 hitters combining for all but one of the team’s 10 RBI.\n\nEach of Grand Canyon’s first three pitchers utilized allowed at least three runs, with starter Carter Young taking the loss. He allowed four runs in one inning, scattering four hits and walking a pair.",

(0:50)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nEASTLAKE, Ohio -- There is indeed crying in baseball, and for Birmingham-Southern, there were also many tears of joy.\n\nA magnificent, almost magical postseason ride ended in heartbreak.\n\nMore heartbreak.\n\nThe Panthers' inspiring run, which came as the liberal arts college in Alabama was being shut down for financial failure after more than 160 years, ended Sunday with an 11-10 loss to Wisconsin-Whitewater in the Division III College World Series.\n\nIt was a painful, seemingly unfair finish for a never-say-die team that had lifted a tight-knit community devastated by the school's closing while captivating the hearts of American sports fans who could relate to the Panthers' feel-good story, a mixture of loss, grief and pride.\n\n\"I don't feel sadness right now and I mean it,\" said coach Jay Weisberg, who took over BSC's program in 2007 and built into one of the nation's strongest at the D-III level. \"The ride that these guys have given me this year has been absolutely incredible.\n\n\"Coaching is what I love, and these guys have made it so fun.\"\n\nBirmingham-Southern built a 10-5 lead through six innings, but couldn't put away Wisconsin-Whitewater, which scored two runs in the seventh, three in the eighth and got a walk-off homer from Sam Paden leading off the ninth.\n\nSomeone had to be the villain.\n\nWhen Paden's homer cleared the wall in left, several Birmingham-Southern players stood still as if frozen in disbelief.\n\nThere wouldn't be a storybook ending after all.\n\nAfter briefly gathering his team in the outfield, Weisberg had his players and the alums who had made the trip from all over the country to see the Panthers one last time stand single file along the third-base line.\n\nTogether they tipped their caps to the BSC fans in the ballpark, a final salute from a team that will never play again. The players then walked off the field in small groups, hand in hand.\n\nThe salute was something Weisberg had planned, a full-circle moment for him and players he had touched.\n\nWeisberg managed to keep his composure during the early portion of his news conference before being asked what he hoped would be the final message of Birmingham-Southern.\n\n\"What a beautiful place it is ... was,\" he said before breaking down in tears.\n\nWeisberg took 25 seconds to compose himself before continuing and speaking about a school that has defined his life.\n\n\"I know a lot of people have pride in their schools, and they should,\" he said. \"We aren't different than many. But it's such a beautiful place, physically. We have the best sunsets in the world. The message about Birmingham-Southern is that it changed lives. It was a place where people came as young men and women and left as mature men and women.\n\n\"What this nation has seen over these last three weeks and the joy that we brought is exactly what this program is -- it's toughness, it's championship baseball, great young men. I love it that the final chapter for Birmingham-Southern could have gone off into the sunset and not many people besides graduates or the Birmingham community would know about it.\n\n\"But now the nation knows there were some pretty special things that happened here.\"\n\nThe doors at BSC were officially shut on Friday as the Panthers opened the eight-team double-elimination tournament with a loss to Salve Regina.\n\n\"What this nation has seen over these last three weeks and the joy that we brought is exactly what this program is -- it's toughness, it's championship baseball, great young man. I love it that the final chapter for Birmingham-Southern could have gone off into the sunset and not many people besides graduates or the Birmingham community would know about it. But now the nation knows there were some pretty special things that happened here.\" Birmingham-Southern coach Jay Weisberg\n\nAnd while they won't be going home with a trophy, Birmingham-Southern's players brought joy to a community still grappling with the fact that the school is gone forever.\n\nBack in March, when the school announced it was closing, Weisberg encouraged his players to play freely, and that's what they did.\n\nAs Wisconsin-Whitewater stormed back, Weisberg's son, JT, remembered to live by his dad's words.\n\n\"When the game got tight, I wasn't worried about winning or losing,\" he said. \"I wanted one more night to be able to hang out with everyone. I think the ride we had the last three weeks is better than winning a national championship.\n\n\"Either way, we're going to get back to campus and we're going to have to all move out and say goodbye to our friends. It's the relationships that last longer than anything we won on this run or anything we could win.\"\n\n\"I hope what people have learned from this is the power of people coming together with love.\"",

            "summary": "Get Joe Goodman’s newsletter: Enter your email to subscribe to Joe’s weekly newsletter, Sports Happy Hour:\n\nThis is an opinion column.\n\n_____________________\n\nJT Weisberg is the son of Birmingham-Southern baseball coach Jan Weisberg.\n\nA junior outfielder on the team, JT’s appreciation for Birmingham-Southern College runs deeper than perhaps anyone in the history of the school. Birmingham-Southern is all that JT Weisberg has ever known.\n\nI don’t mean that figuratively either.\n\nWith his family’s physical residence located on campus, JT was raised at Birmingham-Southern College on Arkadelphia Road.\n\nThe Hilltop was and still is his home. The baseball field is his backyard. Father Jan Weisberg coached at Birmingham-Southern for the final 17 years of the school’s existence, which means that the cocoon that was Birmingham-Southern College formed the complete and total essence of JT Weisberg’s development as a person.\n\nBirmingham-Southern permanently closed last Friday and the baseball team played its final game in the Division III Baseball World Series on Sunday here at Classic Park in Eastlake, Ohio. The story of Birmingham-Southern baseball — the team without a school — grabbed the attention of the country this past week and shined a national spotlight on the circumstances of the school. It was JT Weisberg, son of the coach, child of the campus, who offered a perspective of his school’s story that will stay with me forever.\n\nAfter growing up at Birmingham-Southern, after knowing Birmingham-Southern like a family member, after experiencing the pain of the past two years and the joy of the past three weeks, JT Weisberg gave a testimony that will live on forever.\n\nThe Birmingham-Southern baseball team was eliminated from the D-III Baseball World Series on Sunday by Wisconsin-Whitewater. The ending of the game couldn’t have been more heartbreaking. Wisconsin-Whitewater won 11-10 on a walk-off home run. The first pitch of the bottom of the ninth inning went over the fence.\n\nBirmingham-Southern College went down swinging, but for JT Weisberg it wasn’t about the result at the end of the game. It was about being with his family and friends one more day.\n\n“I think for most of us, when the game got tight tonight, I wasn’t worried about winning and losing,” JT Weisberg said. “I just wanted one more night to be able to hang out with everyone. And I think the ride that we’ve had the last three weeks have been better than winning a national championship for me.\n\n“I mean, either way, if we had won the whole thing, we’re still going to get back to campus the next day and we’re all going to have to move out and say bye to your friends. So, I would say that it’s the relationships that last more than anything we’ve won on this run, or anything we could win. And I hope what people have learned from this is the power of just people coming together with love.”\n\nIt was beautiful. It was the power of sports. It was baseball in its purest form. It was love for the sake of loving something one last time.\n\nThe Birmingham-Southern baseball team captured the hearts of the country and gave their players and fans one last moment in the sun. The school is closed. The games are over. The love that radiated from Birmingham-Southern will endure and continue to help warm the world.\n\nThey went out like champions, and they were heroes of a school and its city.\n\nIn a poignant scene, the Birmingham-Southern baseball team and alumni of the baseball program tipped their caps to fans before walking off the field linked arm in arm and hand in hand.\n\nThey were together until the end.\n\nCoach Jan Weisberg then led his men off the field and into history.\n\nAmong the former players were members of Weisberg’s first recruiting class. Those are the players who took a chance on Birmingham-Southern when the school didn’t even have a team. A major part of the curious story that was Birmingham-Southern athletics is the fact that the school competed in Division I from 2001 to 2007. The most notable alum of Birmingham-Southern athletics during that time is current Samford basketball coach Bucky McMillan.\n\nFor Birmingham-Southern grads like McMillan, this perspective is important to understand and one that has been missed by the national media outlets that have covered these final days of the Birmingham-Southern baseball team. In a move that will always remain controversial among alums and former faculty members, Birmingham-Southern chose a different path for itself in 2007.\n\nIn 2008, with the school transitioning to Division III and adding football, Birmingham-Southern didn’t have a baseball team. That’s when Weisberg took over the program and made it his own.\n\nWeisberg relit a fallen torch and then, ultimately, helped carry it to a funeral pyre for the school.\n\nHaving his former players at the World Series was a symbolic moment for the coach. They helped build a new foundation, and then they were there at the end on their sport’s biggest stage.\n\nIt was a full-circle moment for Weisberg and his players and a metaphorical illustration of the influence that collegiate athletics can have on a school of higher learning.\n\nA question for Coach Weisberg after his final game made him pause and collect himself for 25 long seconds. I asked him what the final message will be for Birmingham-Southern. With his son by his side, Weisberg had already offered the world his own personal answer. Then, for one last time, he spoke for the school that helped raise his family.\n\n“What a beautiful place it is … was,” said Weisberg, correcting himself mid-sentence and then pausing to hold back his tears.\n\n“Shoot,” he said. “It’s the ‘was’ that gets me.\n\n“I know that a lot of people have pride in their school, as they well should, and there are a lot of great institutions out there. We aren’t different than many, but it’s one of … the institution is such a beautiful place.\n\n“Physically, it is such a beautiful place. We had the best sunsets in the world. I’ve lived on campus there for 17 years … but the message about Birmingham-Southern is that it changed lives. It was a place where people came as young men and women and left as mature men and women. They went from dependence to independence.\n\n“I would want the message of this program to be that what this nation has seen over these last three weeks, and the joy that we brought, is exactly what this program is. It’s toughness. It’s championship baseball. It’s great young men.\n\n“And I just love the fact that the final chapter of Birmingham-Southern, it could have easily gone off into the sunset, and not many people outside of graduates and even the Birmingham community would have known about it, but now the nation knows that there are some pretty special things that happened here.”\n\nBE HEARD\n\nGot a question for Joe?

            "summary": "STILLWATER, Okla. — With his team's back against the wall, Kevin O'Sullivan entered Sunday's game with a plan things unfolded as he had envisioned. Sort of.\n\nThe 17th year Florida skipper wanted to start southpaw Cade Fisher in the Gators' regional final game against national No. 11-seed Oklahoma State. He wanted to turn the ball over to freshman righty Luke McNeillie when Fisher ran out of steam and he wanted his closer, Brandon Neely, to shut things down.\n\nAnd all of that happened.\n\nBut how each part of O'Sullivan's formula came together escaped the bounds of the blueprint.\n\nAfter pulling Fisher with one out and two runners on in the fourth inning, McNeillie took over and walked the only batter he faced, loading the bases and forcing O'Sullivan to make an immediate call to the bullpen to bring in Neely before the game even reached its halfway point.\n\n\"And that wasn't the plan,\" O'Sullivan said in the game's immediate aftermath. \"We hoped to get to at least the sixth or the seventh before we used him.\"\n\nThe way O'Sullivan said he saw it, there was no other choice but to turn to the junior bullpen ace, though.\n\nThe Gators trailed 2-1, and a loss on Sunday night would have ended their postseason with an unceremonious first-round exit.\n\n\"There was nobody else down in the pen that we were going to go to at that point,\" O'Sullivan said.\n\nAnd, somehow, it worked flawlessly.\n\nNeely cruised through 5.2 scoreless innings of relief, striking out a career-high 11 batters on 104 pitches and steering his team to the most important win of its season to date: a 5-2 victory over the Cowboys to force a decisive regional finale.\n\nThe outing was as heroic as it was unexpected. Above all, Florida knew it was necessary.\n\n\"The only way we were going to win the game is if he was going to finish it,\" O'Sullivan said.\n\nNeely's magnificence was on display almost as soon as he touched the mound.\n\nThe righty fired in three straight strikes to punch out Oklahoma State two-way star Carson Benge, a projected first-round pick in the upcoming MLB Draft, and induced a fly ball to right-center six pitches later, which Florida center fielder Michael Robertson sprawled out to catch in epic fashion.\n\nThe pair of outs limited the Cowboys to just one fourth-inning run, maintaining the Gators' one-score deficit.\n\n\"It was a big confidence boost for sure,\" Neely said. \"Probably one of the most crucial parts of the game right there. To be able to get out of the bases loaded with one out with a zero was a big step in the right direction for the game.\"\n\nHowever, things nearly slipped away again an inning later when Neely issued back-to-back walks to open the fifth before a sacrifice bunt moved the pair into scoring position with one out.\n\nTwo strikeouts quickly mitigated the mess, though, and it was at that point, Neely said, that he realized he could be unstoppable.\n\nHe allowed just two more base runners throughout the rest of the night.\n\n\"When I got out of that with no runs,\" Neely said through a smile and chuckle, \"I knew their chances were pretty slim. That was a big confidence boost just like the fourth inning.\"\n\nThe Gators capitalized from there.\n\nA four-run sixth inning, which was punctuated by a three-run home run from Florida shortstop Colby Shelton, gave Florida the 5-2 lead that held up through the final out.\n\n\"We couldn't have done it without each other,\" Shelton said. \"Every guy stepped up. Whenever there was a crucial moment, someone found a way to get it done and that's what it takes at this time of year.\"\n\nFlorida's ability to step up in big moments wasn't confined to Sunday's nightcap.\n\nAfter losing to the Cowboys on Saturday, the Gators had to play an elimination game against Nebraska on Sunday morning, in which they hit four home runs and scored 17, a total that nullified the potential impact of shaky pitching.\n\nFlorida surrendered 11 runs and utilized seven different pitchers against the Cornhusker, three of whom recorded fewer than three outs.\n\nBut it hardly shook the Gators, who embraced their situation.\n\n\"We're in the right mindset,\" Shelton said. \"We're going to go out there and compete.\"\n\nCarrying that attitude into Monday will be critical.\n\nThe Gator offense, which posted 22 runs across 18 innings on Sunday, will need to produce in bunches again, especially considering the team's situation on the mound where its primary pitchers, Liam Peterson, Jac Caglianone, Pierce Coppola and Neely, have been used and are unavailable for the decisive game seven.\n\nFlorida will instead have to lean on McNeillie, righties Fisher Jameson, Blake Purnell, Jake Clemente, Grayson Smith and Hunter Jones and lefties Robert Satin and Frank Menedez.\n\n\"We've got plenty of arms, it's just a matter of guys stepping up,\" O'Sullivan said. \"It's why you come to Florida. We've been in this position before.\"\n\nAnd the Gators have actually done quite well in it, especially over the last two years.\n\nIncluding Sunday's games, the Gators have won six of their last seven NCAA Tournament elimination games dating back to the start of the 2023 postseason when they rattled off three consecutive victories in the Gainesville Regional to advance to the Super Regional round and later bested LSU in the second game of the nation championship series.\n\n\"We're just going to need certain guys to give us three outs here and three outs there,\" O'Sullivan said. \"It doesn't have to lean on one person. We're going to need, as a collective group, we're going to need some solid outings. But nobody is going to have to feel the pressure of going five innings or six innings or seven. We're going to have to piece it together and we certainly have the numbers.\"\n\nIf it works, the Gators could find themselves back in the Super Regional round for the second year in a row, an outcome that would have been wholly unexpected just a few weeks ago when they were fighting to make the postseason at all.\n\nFlorida has benefited from the unexpected, though. It did Sunday when its closer turned in one of the most heroic performances in recent program history and when its offense came to life just a few hours early to post 17 runs a day after it was a two-hit by Oklahoma State ace Brian Holiday, who threw a complete game.\n\nThe Gators success this postseason has been fitting, considering its season, to date. It's been uniquely Florida.\n\nThey'll look to do it one more time.\n\n\"I'm really proud of these guys,\" O'Sullivan said. \"We're excited that we have an opportunity.\"",

            "summary": "Right-handed pitcher Brandon Neely entered Florida’s elimination game vs Oklahoma State with the bases loaded and one out in the bottom of the 4th. With the Gators trailing 2-1, Neely recorded and a strike out and a fly out to keep it a one run game heading into the 5th.\n\n“It was a big confidence booster for sure. That was probably one of the most crucial parts of the game,” Neely said on getting out of the early jam. “To be able to get out of the bases loaded one out with a zero was a big step in the right direction.”\n\n“I’ve been in a few high-pressure situations,” Neely said after the game. “Especially last year in the College World Series. I just went right at them with nothing to lose, gave it my all and said hit it.”\n\nWell, Oklahoma State didn’t hit it. Neely would go on to finish the game, firing 5.2 scoreless innings of relief, allowing just one hit and three walks while striking out 11 batters. At one point in the game Neely had fanned six straight batters.\n\nDespite tossing 104 pitches vs OSU after 37 Nebraska on Friday night, Neely never ran out of gas, reaching 96 MPH on his 101st pitch of the game on Sunday night. It became evident as the game progressed and Neely’s confidence grew that he wouldn’t be coming out of Florida’s must-win match. It was his game to win or lose.\n\n“It was definitely a grind,” Neely said postgame. “I was going out there to finish it from the 4th…I wasn’t letting Sully take it out of my hands.”\n\nHead coach Kevin O’Sullivan didn’t have any plans to.\n\n“The only way we were going to win the game was for him to finish it, to be honest with you, because we need to have some pitching for tomorrow,” O’Sullivan said postgame.\n\nNeely’s stuff was excellent tonight. His rising fastball generated a ton swing and misses, and his slider was the sharpest I’ve seen it all season.\n\nNot only did Neely’s heroic effort send Florida into game seven of the Stillwater Regional, but the length of his outing saved the Gators’ bullpen arms for the championship game.\n\n“We got plenty of arms, it’s just a matter of some guys stepping up,” O’Sullivan said postgame. “We will talk to the pitching staff tomorrow. We got numbers.”\n\nFlorida is set to take on Oklahoma State on Monday at 3:00 PM with the winner advancing to the Super Regionals.",

            "summary": "A lot of baseball happens in a weekend. This time around saw the Yankees' superstars crush it in the Bay, the Brewers tighten their grip in the NL Central, the White Sox have fighting words off the field (but not much on the diamond) and the Mariners sound serious about fixing their hitting woes.\n\nHere’s what you need to know from the weekend across MLB.\n\nNobody in MLB has more wins than the New York Yankees (42). And that’s because the Bronx Bombers rolled into San Francisco and bullied the Giants behind dominant performances from their superstars. It was the baseball equivalent of a ruthless noogie.\n\nThe series was defined by the storyline of Bay Area kid Aaron Judge playing his first career games at Oracle Park after his dramatic free-agent frenzy broke the hearts of Giants fans (remember Arson Judge?). The big man stole the show in the opener, thumping a pair of big flies to help the Yankees to a 6-2 win. But the next day was truly unforgettable.\n\nIn the first inning of Saturday’s contest, Judge obliterated a Logan Webb changeup for a supersonic, 464-foot monster shot in another Yanks victory.\n\n464 FEET 😳\n\n\n\nAaron Judge hits his 21st home run of the season.\n\n\n\n(via @Yankees)\n\npic.twitter.com/RfJC9cvvdj — Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) June 2, 2024\n\nSan Francisco entered the ninth inning Sunday with a two-run lead and a chance to salvage the finale. Crucially, however, the Yankees employ Juan Soto. After an Anthony Volpe triple cut the lead to one, Soto smashed a grooved Camilo Doval heater into the right-field seats for a one-run lead. It was a Murphy’s Law weekend for the Giants and their fans.\n\nThe Yanks head home after a very successful nine-game California trip — they went 7-2 — for a series against (who else?) their all-time punching bag: the Minnesota Twins.\n\nJackson Chourio showers Willy Adames with well wishes after Adames hit a walk-off single on Saturday. (Photo by John Fisher/Getty Images)\n\nBrewers take advantage of slumping Cubs with sweep of woeful White Sox\n\nMilwaukee took care of business against the woeful White Sox in one of the weekend’s three sweeps. After a 23-hit barrage in the opener, the Brewers edged out the White Sox behind solid pitching in the last two games from rookie Robert Gasser, ace Freddy Peralta and a lockdown bullpen. That makes five consecutive wins for Milwaukee, which, alongside the Cubs' recent nose dive, has given the Brew Crew a sturdy seven-game advantage atop the NL Central.\n\nRhys Hoskins’ return from injury a few days ago will only help the Brewers' surging offense as Milwaukee heads to Philadelphia this week for a scintillating showdown between two of the circuit's best clubs.\n\nThe White Sox, on the other hand, are a catastrophe coated in disaster wrapped in calamity and deep fried in debacle. They have now lost 11 consecutive baseball matches and are MLB’s worst team by a significant margin. At 15-45, Chicago is on pace to finish the season with 40 wins, which would tie the 1962 New York Mets for the single lowest winning percentage in MLB’s expansion era.\n\nThings got particularly odd Sunday after fearless veteran outfielder Tommy Pham tried to square up with Brewers catcher William Contreras after a play at the plate. It got relatively chirpy on the diamond, but the 36-year-old Pham — who is almost certainly trade bait for the Sox — took it to another level during his postgame media availability by referencing his offseason fighting regimen.\n\nThe 2024 White Sox are a singular experience.\n\n“There’s a reason I do all kinds of fighting in the offseason. Because I’m prepared to f—- somebody up” -Tommy Pham pic.twitter.com/REBPGPj5BX — CHGO White Sox (@CHGO_WhiteSox) June 2, 2024\n\nExpect Orioles to be active on trade market after losing 2 huge arms\n\nBaltimore general manager Mike Elias dropped a bad news bomb on Friday, announcing that two of his team’s pitchers, John Means and Tyler Wells, would be undergoing surgery for torn UCLs. For Means, who underwent Tommy John surgery in May 2022 but struggled through his return to play, it’s a particularly cruel blow. Wells had started for Baltimore in the early going but was likely bullpen-bound come late summer. The double-whammy increases the likelihood that Elias acts aggressively at the trade deadline.\n\nIn the short term, Baltimore has to move forward with the best 13 pitchers currently in the organization. That task got off to a great start Friday against Tampa when 36-year-old journeyman Albert Suárez delivered five strong frames in a win. On Saturday, the Birds slugged four long balls in a 9-5 win before the Rays returned with a comeback victory Sunday.\n\nIt's not surprising that Baltimore can really hit, but how the Orioles go about assembling their solid, not dominant, pitching staff in the face of these recent injuries will be crucial to their long-term success. Good to see Craig Kimbrel roaring again; the future Hall of Famer has steadied the ship with eight scoreless outings after a very rocky start to May.\n\nWill Mariners' firing of hitting coordinator turn things around at the plate?\n\nIt was an odd weekend in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nSeattle swept the hapless Angels because, surprise, surprise, Mariners starting pitchers didn’t allow a single earned run across 20 innings. That’s how the Mariners do things. This rotation is downright dynamite, potentially historically good when it’s all done and dusted.\n\nBryan Woo, still on a strict pitch limit, carved on Friday. Bryce Miller, the gangly, flame-throwing Texan, punched out nine Halos on Saturday. Luis Castillo, ol’ reliable, shoved seven scoreless on Sunday. Ho-hum stuff for the M’s.\n\nAs good as Seattle has been on the bump, they’ve been that horrendous in the batters box. The AL West’s horrendous-ness has shrouded the Mariners’ offensive ineptitude, but boy, oh, boy is this team hard to watch hit. The Mariners' struggles culminated in the firing of team “offensive coordinator” Brant Brown on Friday.\n\nBrown was brought in over the offseason to help the Mariners ditch the strikeouts and increase contact. But through two months the club is hitting .223, which isn’t something good teams do.\n\nIt’s rare to see a first-year coach get the heave-ho after just two months, so keep an eye on Seattle’s offense to see if there is a meaningful change.\n\nTigers split with Red Sox, send No. 1 draft pick Spencer Torkelson to Triple-A\n\nDetroit has been treading water of late in a surprisingly competitive AL Central. Kansas City and Cleveland have been spectacular, while Minnesota’s roller-coaster season is back on the upswing. But the Tigers, now a game under .500 after a four-game split at Fenway, have been the epitome of meh. Not good, not awful, just plain, old mediocre.\n\nAnd while there were some definite positives — Jack Flaherty was again sensational, and leadoff man Matt Vierling is on fire — Detroit made a significant transaction Sunday that showed things are far from peachy in the Motor City. Spencer Torkelson, the first overall pick in the 2020 MLB Draft and the presumed savior of Tiger baseball, was optioned to Triple-A after starting the season with an ugly .597 OPS.\n\nThe Tigers hope a reset down in the minor leagues can fix Spencer Torkelson. (Eric Canha/USA TODAY Sports)\n\nDetroit’s rebuild, like any other, is dependent on the blossoming of stars. Its only obvious success in that regard has been the ascension of starting pitcher Tarik Skubal.\n\nTorkelson was supposed to be that for Detroit’s lineup, but his demotion to the minor leagues is an admission that the big first baseman needs a reset. It’s hard to be the face of a franchise in Toledo.",

            "summary": "SAN FRANCISCO -- — Juan Soto homered twice, including a go-ahead drive in a four-run ninth inning against All-Star closer Camilo Doval, and the New York Yankees rallied past the San Francisco Giants 7-5 on Sunday.\n\nGiants starter Blake Snell, a two-time Cy Young Award winner, exited in the fifth with left groin tightness and will undergo an MRI on Monday. He appears headed to the injured list for a second time this season, manager Bob Melvin said.\n\nAnthony Volpe hit an RBI triple and Giancarlo Stanton drove in a run with a ground-rule double against Doval in the ninth.\n\nAaron Judge had two singles while extending his on-base streak to 29 games as the AL East leaders won their fifth straight and completed a 7-2 trip to three California cities with a three-game sweep at Oracle Park.\n\n“We’ve been playing great baseball,” Soto said. “Really happy to come over here and keep doing what we’ve been doing since day one.”\n\nSoto homered off Snell in the first inning, then reached on a bunt single and scored in the fifth.\n\nNew York trailed 5-3 in the ninth before Gleyber Torres got the rally started with a leadoff single. Yankees catcher Jose Trevino grounded into a fielder’s choice, beating out a potential double play, and Volpe sent a line drive into triples alley in right-center to drive in Trevino. Soto followed with his 17th home run to give New York a 6-5 lead, bringing roars from the large chunk of the crowd wearing Yankees gear.\n\nSoto flipped his bat high in the air, pounded his chest and shouted in excitement toward the Yankees’ dugout. New York has homered in a season-high 12 consecutive games.\n\n“I just tried to get something elevated and tried to drive it to the outfield,” Soto said. “It takes every little thing to put an inning like that (together) against a closer of his caliber.”\n\nJudge walked, stole second and continued to third on a throwing error by catcher Curt Casaili before scoring on Stanton’s double to deep right-center.\n\nMelvin stood by his closer despite the loss.\n\n“I felt good with Doval,” Melvin said. “I’ll take him against anybody. It’s just, they got him today.”\n\nMichael Tonkin (2-3) tossed two scoreless innings to earn the win. Clay Holmes worked a perfect ninth for his 17th save.\n\nSoto, the second batter of the game, got the Yankees going when he crushed a 2-2 fastball from Snell into the stands in right-center. The three-time All-Star later laid down a perfect bunt and scored on Alex Verdugo’s two-run double in the fifth.\n\n“That’s some savage at-bats right there,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said of Soto. “Just wow. To get on a pitch like he hit off of Snell to start out … then bookends the day with another homer off Doval. Pretty good day to homer.”\n\nHeliot Ramos homered and drove in three runs for the Giants. Casey Schmitt also connected, and Jorge Soler had three hits. San Francisco has lost four straight.\n\nSnell, the 2023 NL Cy Young Award winner with San Diego, had seven strikeouts and allowed five hits and three runs in his first start against the Yankees since 2020. Snell has not made it through five innings in any of his six starts with the Giants and has a 9.51 ERA.\n\nRamos hit his third homer of the season off Yankees starter Nestor Cortes in the third, then put the Giants ahead with a two-run single off reliever Dennis Santana in the sixth.\n\nCortes had seven strikeouts and no walks in 4 1/3 innings.

            "summary": "Folks who are expecting to see a dazzling parade of planets on Monday June 3 may be disappointed by what they end up seeing in the sky and, instead, experts are saying they should manage their expectations and wait until the end of the month to see the planetary alignment.\n\nThe past couple of months have been pretty eventful for backyard astronomers. First, the solar eclipse in April, then the northern lights made a rare appearance in May, and now a parade of planets will make its 2024 debut.\n\nStargazers are supposed to be able to see six planets, Jupiter, Mercury, Uranus, Mars, Neptune and Saturn, aligned.\n\nHowever, experts from NASA and Astronomers Without Borders both agree that it won't be the best time to see the planetary parade. That's because Uranus, Mercury and Jupiter will be swallowed up by the sun's light and be too close to the horizon to be visible.\n\nNorthern lights:Northern lights in US were dim compared to 'last time mother nature showed off': What to know\n\nExperts say be patient: Planet parade will be more of a show later in June\n\n\"To me, the closest thing to a planet parade is June 29th, when you’ll have Saturn, the third-quarter Moon, Mars, and Jupiter arrayed across the sky at dawn,\" Preston Dyches, a public engagement specialist for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory told USA TODAY. Dyches has a background in astronomy and hosts NASA's \"What's Up,\" a monthly video series that describes what's happening in the night sky.\n\nAndrew Fazekas, the communications manager for Astronomers Without Borders, says that when it comes to the planetary parade on June 3, it will be nearly impossible to see all the planets with the naked eye.\n\nBoth Fazekas and Dyches agree that it's better to see the planetary parade on June 29, instead.\n\nOn June 3, Jupiter, Mercury and Uranus are going to be \"way too close to the sun,\" said Fazekas. So, it will be difficult to see those three planets.\n\nSo, folks who do decide to rise before the sun does on Monday morning just to get a glimpse at this celestial phenomenon could be setting themselves up for disappointment.\n\nIn this case, good things come to those who wait. And waiting until the end of the month will give stargazers a better chance at viewing the planets.\n\n\"If you're patient and you wait until the end of the month, these planets will move farther away from the sun higher up in the early morning sky,\" Fazekas told USA TODAY \"So, that you will get an easier chance to pick them out in the sky.\n\nFolks will not only get a better view of the planetary parade if they wait until June 29, but they'll be able to gaze at the stars on Friday night into Saturday morning, instead of having to view it during the work week like they would this Monday morning.\n\nExcitement from solar eclipse, northern lights creating planet parade hype\n\nPeople are expecting to see something amazing the morning of June 3, said Fazekas. But, he's worried the expectations set by two very viral celestial events, the solar eclipse and northern lights, and sensationalization on social media could raise people's expectations a bit too high and lead to a lackluster experience.\n\nHe adds that he's concerned one bad experience that was overhyped online could steal people's enthusiasm about astronomy.\n\n\"What worries me is that we set people up for disappointment,\" said Fazekas \"And then they won't want to do it again.\"\n\nAccording to Fazekas, he's never seen so many people interested in sky-watching, and he doesn't want the excitement to end.\n\nWhat will you be able to see?\n\nAccording to a program called SkySafari Pro, you will be able to see the following during the planetary parade on June 29:\n\nJupiter, which will be closest to the horizon.\n\nUranus.\n\nMars.\n\nThe moon.\n\nNeptune.\n\nSaturn.\n\nWhat is a planetary parade?\n\nBasically, it's when the planets form a straight line and look like they're marching across the night sky and form a sort of space parade.\n\nIt's also known as a large planetary alignment, states Delaware Online, a part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nWhat equipment do you need to view a planetary parade?\n\nAccording to Fazekas, you will still need binoculars and telescopes to see some of the planets.\n\n\"Neptune is a planet that you need strong binoculars or a small telescope to be able to see,\" said Fazekas. \"And it's not easy to find either.\"\n\nFolks who go out to stargaze on June 28, will be able to see Neptune right next to the moon. On June 29, it will be farther away from the moon, and be above it instead.\n\nApps, like Skyview on the Apple app store, can turn people's phones into a tool that helps them identify celestial bodies in the night sky.\n\nWhere will you be able to see the planetary parade?\n\nAccording to Fazekas, people will need to do the following to get a view of the planetary parade:",

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nA “planet parade” during which six planets will appear to align in the sky near dawn is on the way, but only three planets will be visible with the naked eye — and the phenomenon is more common than it sounds.\n\n“You’ll be able to see Mars, Saturn and Jupiter,” said Dr. James O’Donoghue, a planetary astronomer and research fellow at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. “If you have binoculars and if you know where to look, you could probably see Uranus, but there’s not much point in waiting until nearly sunrise — you might as well do that earlier in the night. Bottom line is that you can only see about half the planets in this planetary lineup with a naked eye.”\n\nThe best day to see the spectacle in Europe and North America will be Sunday, about half an hour before sunrise, according to O’Donoghue. Aiming for that time frame would give you a chance to spot Mercury as well, although it might not be easy even with binoculars, he said.\n\n“The problem is that the sun will be illuminating the sky in that area,” O’Donoghue added. “It’s just before the sunrise, but it will still be very, very bright in the sky, and you probably don’t want to be pointing your binoculars near the sun either.”\n\nIf you have one, a telescope would help, especially if you’re hoping to spot Uranus and Neptune. “But to actually be able to see these, you need to be zooming in to one target so much that you’re not seeing the others anyway, so you’d be getting rid of all your field of view,” he said.\n\nThe order in which the planets will align on Sunday is Jupiter, Mercury, Uranus, Mars, Neptune and Saturn, and they will be accompanied by a crescent moon. Later in the week, by Thursday, the moon will be out of the way — reducing light pollution, O’Donoghue noted — and Mercury will have switched positions with Jupiter.\n\nThe alignment will be visible to sky-watchers everywhere, but the ideal date to see the planets with the closest alignment might differ depending on where you are in the world.\n\nPlanetary alignments: What to know\n\nIt’s important to note that this alignment is not happening in space, but just in the sky as seen from our planet.\n\n“From the point of view of someone standing on the Earth, looking at the sky, it will look like there is more or less a straight line of planets, which you could call a planetary alignment or a planetary parade,” said Dr. Kate Pattle, a lecturer at the department of physics and astronomy of the University College London.\n\n“But physically, there’s no actual alignment happening. It’s just that most of the planets are more or less on the same side of the sun at the moment. If the planets actually aligned with each other in space, that would be called a syzygy and that’s a much, much rarer event,” she added.\n\nThis kind of planetary alignment is in fact not rare at all. “There’s going to be several more in the next couple of years, because the outer planets move in the sky more slowly, as they’re further away from us, creating lots of chances for these kinds of alignments to happen,” Pattle said. “Actually, a probably better one is going to happen next February, when we’ll have all of the planets in the sky at the same time, including Venus which is missing from this one.”\n\nPattle recommends Monday, about an hour before sunrise, as the best chance to see the show in most parts of the world, and she is more optimistic about Mercury joining the group of planets visible without instruments.\n\n“Mercury is usually visible with the naked eye if you’re somewhere with low light pollution, but it’s better with binoculars because (the planet is) not particularly bright and it’s only visible shortly before dawn, so it’s usually on a fairly bright background,” she said.\n\nAn app such as Stellarium Mobile or Night Sky can come in handy if you’re unsure where to look, and ideally you’ll need to be somewhere with low light pollution and a low horizon, because Jupiter, Mercury and Uranus are not going to be very far above it, Pattle said.\n\nYou should also try to be somewhere with a good view to the east, because this will be more or less in the direction of the sunrise. “Jupiter will be the easiest to spot, because it’ll be the brightest thing in the sky after the moon,” Pattle said. “The other planets, they’re not easy to distinguish, but they don’t twinkle in the same way that stars do, so that’s one way to spot them.”",

            "title": "Want to watch the ‘parade of planets’? It might not be what you expect.",
            "summary": "On Monday, a half-dozen planets will form a line in the sky — one for each side of a dice, but don’t bet on seeing all of them at once. You’ll be lucky to see just two. During what has been called the “parade of planets,” Jupiter, Mercury, Uranus, Mars, Neptune and Saturn will form a slope in the sky — with a crescent moon appearing in the middle of the lineup. How many of those planets will you really be able to see? While the name suggests you’ll be able to see the whole lineup, just two will be visible to the naked eye.\n\nThe spectacle is “not what it’s all cracked up to be,” said Noah Petro, a scientist with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter project at NASA. “It’s kind of throwing a wet blanket on the whole ‘parade of planets’ in the night sky.”\n\n“They will all be out here, it will just be hard to see,” Petro added.\n\nWhich planets will be visible June 3?\n\nViewers around the world will be able to see Mars and Saturn — as long as you have with clear skies and a determination to wake up early. If you’re a morning person or want to get up about an hour before the sun, you’ll get to see the pair grace skies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMars may have faint red tint and Saturn will be a bright point in the sky, Petro said. But NASA experts want to urge sky-watchers to manage their expectations.\n\nThe family portrait moment, called a planetary alignment, happens when several planets are gathering on one side of the sun at the same time. Planets that are closer to the sun have shorter comparative years, orbiting around the sun faster relative to further planets that have longer years and more distance to travel. In these events, planets closer to the sun join the outer planets that stay in the same area of the sky longer, Rice said.\n\nThe planetary pairing of Mars and Saturn will be visible for most of the month, NASA ambassador Tony Rice said.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nWhy won’t other planets be visible?\n\nMercury and Jupiter will be so low to the horizon that they won’t be visible. Uranus will be faint. Neptune is never visible to the naked eye because it’s too faint for the human eye to see, Petro said. In fact, Neptune will be more than six times dimmer than Uranus, according to NASA. You’d need a telescope to see Uranus and Neptune — the two furthest planets from Earth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Pretty much everything between Venus and Saturn is visible to us. Everything past Saturn, you’re going to need a pretty sizable telescope to be able to see,” Rice said. Not just a any telescope would work for Neptune and Uranus, Rice added, but a “mortgage-payment-sized telescope.”\n\nHow rare is to see multiple planets at once?\n\nAlthough we aren’t able to see multiple planets in the sky every night, this isn’t a rare event, Petro said. You have a chance to see a few planets in the night sky every few months. But if you have clear skies, you might want to take advantage of ideal conditions — you never know when clouds could obscure the show.\n\n“Never postpone an opportunity to enjoy the night sky” Petro said.\n\nThe next planetary meetup will be June 29, when Saturn, Mars, Jupiter and the moon will be visible with the naked eye in the early morning hours. And if you have a telescope, you’ll get to see a little more detail.\n\n“The event later this month will be a great opportunity with the telescope to go out and look at Saturn, maybe see its rings. To Jupiter, see its moons. Mars to see its red,” Petro said.",

            "title": "Liberty limit Caitlin Clark to her worst WNBA game yet in rout of Fever",
            "summary": "Sandy Brondello felt that the Indiana Fever had started to figure everything out, that they had made strides in the two weeks since the teams last met. But it seems as if the Liberty have figured out Caitlin Clark and the Fever offense, too.\n\nIn their first meeting, Betnijah Laney-Hamilton held Clark to nine points and was a franchise-record plus-32. Two days later, Clark flashed her potential with a 10-point first quarter and 22 total. But Sunday, when the Liberty and Fever met for the third time in less than three weeks, Clark was nearly eliminated altogether.\n\n4 Sabrina Ionescu #20 of the New York Liberty and Caitlin Clark at Barclays Center on Sunday night. Michelle Farsi/New York Post\n\nShe finished with a career-low three points before getting dinged in the ear on a screen in the fourth quarter, briefly going back to the locker room and later returning to the bench in the Liberty’s 104-68 win. Laney-Hamilton and Kayla Thornton mostly split the task of guarding Clark, and that allowed the Liberty to secure their best start (7-2) since the league’s inaugural season in 1997. The game doubled as the Commissioner’s Cup opener.\n\n“The way Betnijah guards [Clark],” Sabrina Ionescu said, “I’m happy she’s on our team. But collectively as a team, we understand who kind of the head of the monster is on that team, and trying to just make everything tough and difficult.”\n\nLaney-Hamilton also led the Liberty with 20 points, while Jonquel Jones poured in 18 and snagged 13 rebounds. The Liberty shot 57 percent from the field and 44 percent from 3 in a sample that resembled the offense that propelled their run to the WNBA Finals last year.\n\n4 The Indiana Fever’s Caitlin Clark is defended by the Liberty’s Kayla Thornton in the Libs’ crushing win at Barclays Center. Michelle Farsi/New York Post\n\nClark’s lone basket came on a 3-pointer to start the second quarter, but that was it. She shot 1 of 10 from the field and 1 of 7 on 3s. Late in the first half, she tried to drive for a layup and was blocked from behind by Thornton. Then, Clark missed a transition layup with Ionescu chasing her down. And with Laney-Hamilton picking up on the ball, opponents — such as the Fever — can’t start their offense until 12 seconds remain on the shot clock, Ionescu said.\n\n“It’s more of a chess match,” Laney-Hamiltion said of guarding Clark, “but … because I’m always having to do it, I’m kind of always ready and prepared for that moment.”\n\n4 Breanna Stewart Michelle Farsi/New York Post\n\nInstead, Clark became a facilitator, dishing out five assists and watching as NaLyssa Smith and Kelsey Mitchell helped the Fever trim an 18-point halftime deficit to 12 in the third quarter, but that advantage quickly ballooned again. The Liberty even shifted Laney-Hamilton to Mitchell in the second half.\n\n“Hey, why not?” Brondello said. “That’s the luxury that we have.”\n\nThis all unfolded 30 hours after the Fever’s game against the Chicago Sky included a twist of controversy when Chennedy Carter shoved Clark to the ground. One day later, the league changed the call from a common foul to a flagrant I. Carter refused to answer questions about the hard foul Saturday and later wrote on Instagram that she’d “rather you hate me.”\n\n4 Sabrina Ionescu of the New York Liberty handles the ball during a game against the Fever on Sunday. Michelle Farsi/New York Post\n\nFever coach Christie Sides commended Clark for how she handled the situation, for how she asked the official to review it and didn’t try to respond otherwise. But the Fever struggled to channel the progress from what ended as a one-point win into anything that became a tangible threat to the Liberty’s third consecutive victory.\n\nLaney-Hamilton’s points, which tied her season-high, on 7-for-9 shooting continued an offensive emergence dating back to late in the 2023 campaign, once her role on the superteam — one different from her previous two years with the organization — came into focus and she became one of the Liberty’s most consistent scorers in the playoffs. They used her in isolation Sunday. They created scenarios where her back was to the basket, where Laney-Hamilton could weave and twist and weave again until finding just enough space.\n\nSo in plenty of ways, Sunday was déjà vu for the Liberty. It was déjà vu for the Fever — the latest reminder that it’ll take time for Clark to adjust — in their return to Brooklyn. There were still Clark signs and the No. 22 jerseys scattered throughout the crowd that’ll accompany them everywhere, but this time, the Liberty unveiled the most effective blueprint yet for containing her.",

It was the lowest point total and field goal rate (10%) in a game during both her time in the WNBA (11 games) and college (139 games at Iowa).\n\n\"I think collectively, as a team, we understand who kind of the head of the monster is on that team, and we are trying to just make everything tough and difficult,\" Liberty guard Sabrina Ionescu said of Clark. \"Obviously, they came off a back-to-back, so it's a little bit tough for them, as well. But she'll figure it out. It's not that big of a deal to have a game like that.\"\n\nBetnijah Laney-Hamilton scored 20 points, and Jonquel Jones added 18 for the Liberty, who were nearing the end of the easy win when Clark left the game. Clark, the No. 1 pick in April's draft, played the first few minutes of the fourth quarter before exiting, holding her ear for a bit as she left the court. She was hurt while getting bumped on a screen.\n\nClark was fine afterward.\n\nThe Fever had another scary moment a few minutes later when Aliyah Boston went down awkwardly with an ankle injury after she was fouled. She gingerly walked off the court and back to the locker room.\n\nIndiana coach Christie Sides didn't have an update on the extent of Boston's injury, but last season's Rookie of the Year seemed to be OK while walking around in front of the locker room.\n\nIndiana was playing the second game of a back-to-back set. The Fever (2-9) beat the Chicago Sky on Saturday by one point.\n\nThe Fever have had a brutal stretch to the start the season, with 11 games in the first 20 days, including playing New York three times now.\n\n\"Their legs were shot. I mean, that's where everything stems from, your legs, when you shoot the basketball -- especially for 3s,\" Sides said. \"They're shot, they're gassed, so everything was a little short.\"\n\nThe Liberty took advantage of the tired Fever, racing out to a 31-13 lead after one quarter. Laney-Hamilton and Breanna Stewart each had seven points in the opening 10 minutes as New York pushed the pace.\n\nClark was scoreless in the first quarter before starting off the second quarter with a logo 3-pointer. She was constantly hounded defensively by Laney-Hamilton and Kayla Thornton.\n\nClark did finish with five assists, and she has now led or co-led the Fever in assists in all 11 games this season, extending the second-longest such streak to start a career in WNBA history (Ticha Penicheiro, 26).\n\nNew York led 55-37 at the break. Indiana got within 12 early in the third quarter before the Liberty blew open the game.\n\nKelsey Mitchell scored 21 points to lead Indiana.\n\nInformation from ESPN Stats & Information and The Associated Press was used in this report.",

            "title": "Jacob Kmatz carries Oregon State baseball to win over UC Irvine in Corvallis Regional, waves goodbye to playoff pain",
            "summary": "CORVALLIS — It was right about this time last year, in the winners’ bracket of the Baton Rouge Regional, when the Oregon State baseball team suffered its first postseason defeat to all but sabotage its Omaha dreams.\n\nAnd Jacob Kmatz watched it all unfold from his couch in Corvallis, sporting a wounded wing and a battered psyche.\n\n“It wasn’t easy,” Kmatz said in February. “Especially not being there with the guys. But I think all of us have felt that pain from last year, whether we were there or not, and so it’s feeding into this year and our motivation and what we’re trying to achieve.”\n\nThe Beavers’ right-hander officially put that pain in the past Saturday night at Goss Stadium, where he tossed one of the best games of his career on one of the biggest stages of his career, lifting Oregon State to a 5-3 victory over the UC Irvine Anteaters in the winners’ bracket of the Corvallis Regional.\n\nThe top-seeded Beavers (44-14) advanced to the regional final, where they will play the winner between No. 2 seed UC Irvine (44-13) and No. 3 seed Tulane at 6 p.m. on Sunday (weather permitting).\n\nGolden Spikes Award semifinalist Travis Bazzana belted a monster two-run home run, Dallas Macias smacked the biggest hit of his career — a two-out, two-strike, two-run single — Elijah Hainline had a three-hit night and scored two runs and Bridger Holmes recorded his biggest save of the season. But it was Kmatz and his masterful start that nudged the Beavers to the doorstep of the super regionals.\n\n“Jacob Kmatz was really good,” Anteaters coach Ben Orloff said. “He looked like a frontline Pac-12 guy that started 45 games in his career. I thought he threw the ball really well.”\n\nFrom his first pitch to his last, Kmatz was exceptional, overpowering one of college baseball’s best lineups like few others have this season. He started hot, striking out the first five batters he faced, and closed strong, retiring the final six batters he faced. In between, the Anteaters — who entered the game ranked eighth in the nation in batting average and ninth in runs scored — had no answer.\n\nKmatz didn’t allow a base runner until the third inning, and it came on an OSU throwing error. He didn’t allow a hit until the fourth. And he didn’t allow a run until the fifth, when he gave up back-to-back two-out doubles. The 6-foot-3 junior went on to toss seven electric innings, during which he recorded nine strikeouts, allowed just one run, and surrendered three hits and a walk.\n\nHe worked ahead in counts, tossing first-pitch strikes to 18 of the 26 hitters he faced, and when he did go deep on hitters, he bucked up, striking out four of the five batters who worked him for full counts.\n\nBut it was those five strikeouts to open the game that first caused Goss to buzz.\n\n“You want to set the tone,” Kmatz said. “That’s a big part of it. We had a big win yesterday and … you’re just thinking about that first pitch and executing that first one and then you go from there. So just bringing energy and wanting to provide the guys with energy.”\n\nIt was completely different than the energy Kmatz carried this time last year, when he was sidelined with a sprained elbow just before the postseason. It was a personal nightmare watching the Beavers lose from his couch, and as he spent the summer resting and rehabilitating, Kmatz couldn’t help but imagine the day he could put that nightmare behind him.\n\n“It feels awesome to be out there in that environment again,” Kmatz said. “You watch it on TV from the couch and you put yourself in that position. Just feeling it and being in that moment, you’re present with it, and those are the moments you work for every day.”\n\nAs for the Beavers’ offense, well, it produced all it would need with two memorable swings. The first came in the bottom of the third, when Bazzana annihilated a two-run homer down the right field line. He was so out in front of the 3-2 pitch, he thought he hooked it foul. So Bazzana dipped his head, stepped away from the plate toward the visiting dugout, and started to clear his head for the next pitch.\n\nBut he was startled out of his daze by a stunner: The ball soared high and deep — and fair — over the right field fence, staying just inside the foul pole. It left the stadium before Bazzana even left the plate.\n\nWhen he realized what had happened, Bazzana screamed and flexed and bolted toward first base, then did it again as he rounded third, unleashing a torrent of emotion after staking the Beavers a 2-0 lead.\n\n“Playoff atmosphere, two-run shot … and the surprise of (the ball) coming back fair led to a little emotion,” said Bazzana, who belted his 28th homer of the season. “I think Jacob was just setting the tone with his energy and the way he was attacking hitters. So for us on offense to step up and kind of have the same energy as him; it was just the time and place to bring it.”\n\nThe other big Beavers swing came in fifth, when Macias stepped to the plate with the bases loaded. The sophomore outfielder quickly got down 1-2 in the count when Anteaters starter Trevor Hansen tried to sneak a pitch by him on the inside part of the plate. Macias turned on it and ripped a sharp single through the hole to right field, scoring Hainline and Mason Guerra to give the Beavers a 4-1 lead.\n\nIt was all the cushion they would need. After veteran right-hander Joey Mundt coughed up two runs in the eighth, Holmes retired the final two outs of the inning and then pitched a scoreless ninth, closing the door on his 13th save of the season.\n\nIt pushed the Beavers to the doorstep of the super regionals — and preserved a special outing for Kmatz (7-2). He ended his memorable night with a strikeout, after which he unleashed a fist pump and a scream toward the night sky, as 4,224 at Goss delivered a standing ovation.\n\n“Kmatz threw the heck out of the ball tonight,” Beavers coach Mitch Canham said. “He just kept getting better and better. As I was telling Jacob … being in the dugout, you live through the guys on the field a little bit. You can really feel their emotion … that emotion came out of Jacob tonight. It made (me) really feel that special moment, the fire that’s in them right now.”\n\n— Joe Freeman | jfreeman@oregonian.com | 503-294-5183 | @BlazerFreeman | Subscribe to The Oregonian/OregonLive newsletters and podcasts for the latest news and top stories.",

            "summary": "Brady Kasper\n\nPostseason baseball is back in Goss, as Oregon State has earned the #15 overall national seed and are hosting their fifth regional in the last seven seasons. Joining the Beavers in Corvallis are the UC Irvine Anteaters, Nicholls Colonels and Tulane Green Wave. Oregon State is matched up with the Lexington regional and should the Beavers win this regional they will play the winner of that one.\n\nAfter a sloppy second inning in game one against Tulane where they allowed three runs, the Beavers bounced back to dominate in a 10-4 win. Mason Guerra got the party started in the bottom of the second for Oregon State with a 2-RBI double to cut the Green Wave lead to one run. The game would remain 5-2 until the bottom of the fifth where Gavin Turley came through with his fifth grand slam of the season to left field that gave OSU a 6-3 lead. Tulane would get one back on a solo home run before Micah McDowell stretched the Beaver lead to four with a 2-RBI single. Trent Caraway provided OSU with an insurance run with an RBI knock before Travis Bazzana launched a mammoth shot to dead center that gave OSU a 10-4 lead. McDowell had four hits for the Beavers, while Bazzana, Caraway and Dallas Macias each had two. Aiden May was solid for OSU on the mound, going 5 and ⅔ innings allowing five hits and four runs while also striking out nine. Nelson Keljo had another fantastic outing out of the pen holding Tulane to one hit in 2 and ⅔ innings to go with four strikeouts. Bridger Holmes went on with one out in the ninth and struck out the two remaining batters to seal the deal for the Beavers.\n\nIn a crucial game two, Oregon State got a great performance from the pitching staff to take a 5-3 win over UC Irvine. Travis Bazzana opened the scoring for Oregon State in the bottom of the third inning with a moonshot to right field that just stayed a fair ball, scoring two runs for the Beavers. The Anteaters would get one as Dallas Macias couldn't quite come up with a diving catch and a run came across on an RBI double for Woody Hadeen. Macias would later come up clutch with bases loaded single, scoring two runs and giving OSU a 4-1 cushion. Brady Kasper would extend the lead to four with a bases loaded double play. OSU would run into some trouble in the eighth after pulling starter Jacob Kmatz, as a Caden Kendle double and Anthony Martinez sacrifice fly off of Joey Mundt cut the Beaver advantage to two. Bridger Holmes however would come to get the Beavers out of the jam and then retire the side with a pair of nasty strikeouts to seal the win for Oregon State. Elijah Hainline paced the Beavers offensively with three hits, including a triple, and two runs scored. Kmatz was locked in for the Beavers and went seven strong innings, allowing only three hits and one run while issuing a single walk and striking out nine Anteaters. Kmatz picked up his seventh win of the season, while Holmes moved into the top-5 of OSU's single season saves with his 13th of the '24 campaign.\n\nStick with BeaverBlitz tonight as the Beavers look to get past UC Irvine and advance to a super regional.",

            "title": "What drivers said after NASCAR Cup race at WWT Raceway won by Austin Cindric",
            "summary": "Here is what drivers had to say after Sunday’s NASCAR Cup race at World Wide Technology Raceway:\n\nAustin Cindric — Winner: “Honestly, I’m heartbroken for the 12 team. I don’t know what happened to them at the end of the race, but they deserved to win this race. Ryan has been a hell of a leader on this team. This weekend was a great weekend for everybody involved. To have two cars in the fight and an eventual one-two there, like I said, I’m heartbroken for those guys, but this is huge for me. This is huge for this team. I’m so glad I was able to get a win with Brian as my crew chief in the Cup Series. You never know when it’s gonna happen again. I just drove my butt off and hoped for the best.”\n\nDenny Hamlin — Finished 2nd: “We had a top-five car – we didn’t have the best today, but the Yahoo Camry was in the mix, and was able to capitalize on some others misfortune there. We were going to have a top-five day regardless but proud of the team. They did a great job on pit road – Chris (Gabehart, crew chief) and the team brought a great car, just wasn’t quite enough.”\n\nBrad Keselowski — Finished 3rd: “That was strategy. We got behind early for sure, but we kept putting ourselves in position to keep moving forward and I wish I could have gotten second but it was a really hard-fought day for everyone on the Solomon Plumbing Ford Mustang. We will take a lot of good momentum from this one for sure.”\n\nTyler Reddick — Finished 4th: “A rough first stop there. I slid a little long, and just slowed everyone down on the 45 pit crew. We came in eighth and came out in 28th. It took the entire race to claw back from that – just a great effort by the guys. I feel like we were right there with (Austin Cindric) to start the race, so obviously, it is a little bit of a bummer that we had that issue, but that is kind of the name of the game when you come to World Wide Technology Raceway – you have to have a clean race, and unfortunately, we didn’t.”\n\nJoey Logano — Finished 5th: “We weren’t too far off. We were just a few adjustments away of getting our Shell/Pennzoil Mustang as good as our teammates were, but not too bad. We were able to grab some points, which we need to do, and a Penske car got in Victory Lane, so you’ve got to be happy about that. Obviously, we’d rather it be us, but that momentum goes through the whole shop. It’s still a good day. We still scored a bunch of points today with stage points in both stages. A poor qualifying effort, which probably hurt us a little bit on tuning the car and just a little too loose off.”\n\nAustin Dillon — Finished 6th: “That was a huge run for this team. I didn’t expect it after practice, but the guys made some great adjustments and our No. 3 DOW / Rivers are Life Chevy, with Ducks Unlimited on the side of the car, was really solid all day long, even in traffic. It was just a solid day for the No. 3 Chevy team that we really needed.”\n\nChristopher Bell — Finished 7th: “I have no idea what happened. Some sort of motor issue. I’m surprised that I made it to the end. Glad we were able to salvage something out of it. You don’t get race cars like that very often. Whenever you do, you need to take advantage of it. Disappointing day.”\n\nCarson Hocevar — Finished 8th: “This No. 77 Zeigler Auto Group Chevy team did a really good job with everything all race long. We had a really slow stop at the beginning of the race with a lug nut coming off. That really put us behind. We knew we had a great Chevy, so we just did everything we could. We played strategy a little bit to make sure we were on the right end of it. We caught the caution right, but then after that, our car was really good. We ran as high of fourth and we were catching third. Our lights were off, so we were a little slow down pit road. That was probably the difference of getting a top-five finish or not. All-in-all, it was just a really good job by this No. 77 team.”\n\nJustin Haley — Finished 9th: “It was a really good race for the MotoRad 51 team. I’m really proud of the strategy that the Rick Ware Racing team brought. It was a fast competitive car, and we were able to stay with it all day and make positive adjustments. When the final stage started, we really started picking up speed and had a lot of pace in the car. We had some good strategy and ran out of fuel right there at the line, but still got a top-10 and now we’ve got solid momentum going to Sonoma.”\n\nKyle Larson — Finished 10th: “I’m super proud of this top-10 finish. After the spin, I wasn’t expecting that. The car kind of came to life. The No. 5 HendrickCars.com Chevy team did a good job on our strategy. We were on offense there the last 25 laps or so. It went as well as it could, given the circumstances. I’ll take it.”\n\nChase Briscoe — Finished 17th: “I’m not really sure what all happened. I know there were a lot of different strategies there and I don’t know what played out and how it played out. Our car was OK. It definitely seemed like we struggled a little more on the long run than some of the other people, and we were lacking overall grip. Kind of a worst-case scenario for us, how it all played out. But I thought we definitely made our car way better from yesterday. We’ll learn from that and go to Sonoma.”\n\nDaniel Hemric — Finished 18th: “I think we learned a lot collectively as a team today. Our Poppy Bank Chevy struggled early on, but (crew chief) Trent (Owens) kept plugging away and made great changes. We caught a lucky break during stage two, which gave us great track position to start the final stage. I’m proud of how much we improved throughout the day.”\n\nNoah Gragson — Finished 22nd: “We just struggled all weekend with the balance, and struggled with speed, struggled with take-off pace, struggled with long-run speed. Everything was just stuck in dirty air and couldn’t go on new tires, just struggled. Appreciate all these SERVPRO guys. Our 10 team, we’re frustrated, it’s not to our standard today. We’re going to go back to work and figure it out for Sonoma.”\n\nRyan Blaney — Finished 24th: “I never thought in my mind we were short. It’s one of those things. I’m proud of the 12 boys. The Menards/Richmond Ford was fast. I had my work cut out for me holding off Christopher. That was fun. I don’t know what happened to him, but just one lap short. That stinks, but congrats to the 2 team. They did a good job all day. Props to them, Austin. I’m proud for Team Penske and Ford. I’m really happy with our showing today. I don’t know what I’ve got to do to get some luck on our side. I’ve wrecked the last two points races and thought we had a great shot to win today and I ended up bad, so I just appreciate the effort. We just have to keep sticking with it.”\n\nDerek Kraus — Finished 30th: “It was a long day here at Gateway. I felt we had a better car than our results, however, I was never able to get the track position we needed or keep it when we did have it. I’m thankful for Kafka Conveyors and Kaulig Racing for the opportunity, and I look forward to having another shot towards the end of the year.”\n\nKyle Busch — Finished 35th: “It looked like he (Kyle Larson) got loose down the front straightaway into turn one. He was on older tires and trying to get us for a spot. I’m not sure what that single point would mean for him, but it certainly hurt us a lot. It took that point away, as well as the others that we would get for the stage and then also the rest of the day. It’s very frustrating. We can’t afford days like that. The No. 8 Rebel Bourbon Camaro wasn’t what it was last year, but it was a top-10 car and we were going to finish there. Now we’re not going to finish at all.”\n\nJosh Berry — Finished 36th: “I really don’t know what happened. Obviously, with what our past has been with the rotors here, it kind of makes you think that. I went over and looked at the rotors and it looked like they were still on it so it is either that or a tire. … We moved up into the top 15 pretty quickly. The car was pretty good and I was learning a lot. We pushed the exit on the last section a little too hard and got the penalty there. We were still passing cars though and it would have been another good day.”\n\n",

            "title": "Cindric claims victory in Enjoy Illinois 300 after Blaney slows on final lap",
            "summary": "MADISON, Ill. (AP) — Austin Cindric emerged as the surprise winner of the NASCAR Cup series race Sunday at World Wide Technology Raceway when teammate Ryan Blaney apparently ran out of gas while leading on the final lap.\n\nBlaney, the reigning NASCAR Cup series champion, appeared to be on his way to his first win of the season after fighting off a challenge from Christopher Bell, who had his own car trouble in the closing laps.\n\nCindric, who had pitted just one lap after Blaney, took advantage of the situation and notched his second career victory. The other came in the 2022 Daytona 500.\n\nDenny Hamlin came in second, recording his sixth straight top-5 finish. Brad Keselowski was third, followed by Tyler Reddick and Joey Logano.\n\nBell had been the dominant car for much of the day in suburban St. Louis, leading 80 of the 240 laps. The three Penske cars — Cindric, Blaney and Logano — did not pit in the break between the second and third stages, and that put them in position to go for the win.\n\nBlaney and Bell, the winner of last week’s rain-shortened Coca-Cola 600, dueled for the lead for several laps before Bell — just after finally squeezing ahead of Blaney briefly — let up and reported motor issues to his crew. Bell wound up seventh, getting a push by teammate Martin Truex Jr. on the straightaways in the final laps.\n\nBlaney settled for 24th, coasting around as the last finisher on the lead lap.\n\nMichael McDowell started on the pole and led the first 40 laps before Bell maneuvered his way inside to take the lead for the first time.\n\nKyle Busch, last year’s winner who struggled with grip in practice and qualifying on Saturday, pitted on lap 19 during an early caution and took the lead following the restart when other leaders pitted after Stage 1 concluded on lap 45.\n\nBut Bell quickly carved through the eight cars that hadn’t pitted and reclaimed the lead on the 69th lap.\n\nDEFENDING CHAMP CRASHES\n\nBusch and Kyle Larson were battling side-by-side for seventh on the final lap of Stage 2 when they got together in an incident that took the defending race champion out.\n\nAfter the two rubbed on the front stretch, Larson tried to dive inside Busch going into Turn 1, but he got loose in the process. Larson’s car slid up the track and forced Busch into the wall. Busch’s race was over, but Larson was able to pit and return to the race in 29th place.\n\n“Trying to race for a playoff spot and, you know, gradually falling there a little bit,” said Busch, who was the runner-up in the track’s inaugural Cup series race in 2022 before winning last year. “He got loose and wiped us out.”\n\nOn their radio communications, Larson and his spotter accused Busch of causing the crash by giving him no room on the inside.\n\nARMSTEAD GIVES BACK\n\nMiami Dolphins offensive tackle Terron Armstead, who is from nearby Cahokia, Illinois, brought 20 area kids to the race as part of his foundation’s growing efforts in the community.\n\nArmstead hosted his second annual charity basketball game Friday and his 10th annual football skills camp on Saturday\n\n“The overall goal for everything this weekend is really exposure and introduction to different industries, different paths, a lot of different walks of life, different sports, networking, meeting new people, connecting dots, relationship building,” said Armstead, who recently restructured his contract in hopes of helping the Dolphins win the Super Bowl.\n\n“That’s the goal — and for memories.

            "title": "Cindric's WWTR win brings massive shakeup to Cup playoffs",
            "summary": "The NASCAR Cup Series playoff picture has its first major shakeup.\n\nHeading into Sunday’s Enjoy Illinois 300, the Cup Series season had mostly followed season-long trends. The only driver outside of the current top 16 in points to win a race was Daniel Suarez, and he did so in the second race of the year, so the win’s been something teams could account for from early on.\n\nAll other wins had come from drivers sitting 11th or better in the standings. With only two drivers within 80 points of the playoff cutline, there were also few drivers worth tracking in the points. The bubble seemed well-defined and few drivers beyond the top 16 had shown any likelihood of winning.\n\nEnter Austin Cindric.\n\nIt took engine woes for Christopher Bell and Ryan Blaney running out of fuel to make happen, but Cindric surged to lead when it counted and scored his second Cup win. The win was well-earned, following a front-row qualifying run and a consistent race. In the scope of the season, though, it seemingly came from nowhere. Cindric entered the weekend 20th in the standings, well beyond the cutline on points.\n\nNow he’s locked into the playoff field, which means there’s one fewer spot available on points. The drivers vying for those final positions also saw their situations change.\n\nOne thing affecting all of them is uncertainty over just how many positions they’re competing for. NASCAR has yet to decide on the playoff eligibility waiver request sent in for Kyle Larson after he skipped the start of Coca-Cola 600 to contest the Indianapolis 500.\n\nShould NASCAR elect to award Larson the waiver, the Californian’s two wins and strong points position will make him a playoff lock. If the sanctioning body deems him ineligible, then Larson’s exit will allow another driver a chance to compete for a title this fall. The tour’s latest points report listed Larson second in the standings, but without any playoff points.\n\nThe biggest loser at Gateway was last year’s big winner, Kyle Busch. A year removed from his win at the track, the Richard Childress Racing star was knocked out of Sunday’s race at the end of Stage 2 when he crashed with – who else — Larson.\n\nBusch was battling with Larson in the final lap of Stage 2 when the pair came together heading into Turn 1. After repeated side-by-side contact down the front straight, Larson was racing to Busch’s inside for 10th and snapped loose, sliding into Busch and sending the two-time champion up into the outside wall in Turn 2.\n\n“It looked like [Larson] got loose, I guess, down the front straightaway into Turn 1,” Busch said afterward. “He was on older tires and trying to get us for a spot. Not sure what that single point was really gonna mean for him, but certainly hurt us a lot because [it] took that point away as well as the others that we’d get for the stage, and then also the rest of the day. Very frustrating.”\n\nThe incident brought Busch’s day to a halt, leaving him 35th when the checkered flag flew. It was a disappointing end to a day that had started with promise after Busch led 15 laps early on.\n\n“We can’t afford days like that,” Busch said. “The Rebel Camaro wasn’t what it was last year, but it was a top-10 car and we were gonna finish there. [Now] we’re not going to finish at all.”\n\nThe best finisher of the bubble drivers was Joey Logano in fifth, the 2022 winner benefitting from the same strategy play that took Cindric to victory lane. Chris Buescher made the most of a quiet day in 14th, with Chase Briscoe finishing three spots back in 17th. Bubba Wallace fell to 21st at race’s end. Blaney went from a winner to a 24th-place finisher after he ran out of fuel on the final lap.\n\nWith Suarez and Cindric locked into the playoffs with wins, the final spot on points sits in either 14th or 15th pending the waiver decision for Larson. Should Larson be granted the waiver, then Blaney (+47), Wallace (+13) and Buescher (+10) will be the drivers above the cutline. Briscoe (-10) would be the first one out, with Logano (-14) and Busch (-20) both within reach.\n\nIf Larson’s denied a waiver, Briscoe will jump above the cutline with Logano and Busch in pursuit.\n\nThe good news for all involved is that there’s plenty of time left to improve their position. Eleven races remain in the regular season, including a road course (Sonoma Raceway), a street course (Chicago), a new track (Iowa Speedway) and a wildcard superspeedway (Daytona International Speedway).",

The long layoff between trophy presentations caused her to wonder if she ever would finish atop an event again.\n\n\"I definitely had a little doubt if I can win again,\" she said. \"It just makes it special because after a long wait -- I wasn't expecting to win the U.S. Women's Open. Every time, last time, too, I wasn't expecting it, and this time, too, I wasn't expecting it.\n\n\"I think that's why it made me a bit emotional.\"\n\nSaso won $2.4 million from the $12 million purse, the largest in women's golf and in women's sports at a stand-alone venue.\n\nAt 22 years, 347 days, she became the youngest two-time champion in Open history.\n\nThis time, her win was the byproduct of a furious charge up the leaderboard on the final day. She entered at 2 under overall, 3 shots off the lead.\n\nBy the end of the day, Saso stood alone, carding a 2-under 68 for a 3-shot win. On an afternoon that saw much of the top of the field collapse, Saso's win was all but decided before the final two groups came off the course.\n\nAs she buried a par putt on No. 18 to all but ice the victory, Saso gave a muted, left-armed fist pump, hugged caddie Dylan Vallequette, and casually walked off the course as several fans loudly chanted, \"Yu! Yu! Yu!\"\n\n\"I'm not sure how the other players played. I wasn't looking at the scoreboard,\" Saso said. \"I wasn't too relaxed to be able to see the scoreboard. I just tried to be focused on my routine and my game.\"\n\nWith Saso rattling off four back-nine birdies -- helping to negate a double bogey on No. 6 -- her competitors lost their respective grips on the lead.\n\nFirst, it was Wichanee Meechai. A co-leader entering Sunday at 5 under, Meechai was flat early, with bogeys on the first two holes and a double bogey on the par-3 sixth. Meechai's tee shot on No. 6 approached the pin firmly and at first looked like a potential birdie opportunity. But instead of sticking its landing, the ball slipped off one of the course's notoriously unforgiving greens and fell into a water hazard along the left side.\n\n\"It's the U.S. Open. The pins were so hard,\" Meechai said. \"Sometimes you can play bad golf on one day, but I'm kind of proud of myself that I can handle this week pretty good.\"\n\nMeechai finished tied for sixth; in three previous tries at the Open, she had never finished better than 30th.\n\nWhile Meechai was falling out of the lead, her fellow co-leaders entering the day also couldn't keep pace. Minjee Lee had a hellacious back nine, sandwiching a pair of bogeys with double bogeys on Nos. 12 and 14. She finished tied for ninth.\n\nAmerican Andrea Lee, 25, had a pair of costly bogeys on the final two holes to drop to even for the tournament and into a tie for third.\n\n\"I definitely learned a lot this week about myself,\" said Lee, who's from Southern California. \"I do belong out here, and I feel like I am good enough to win and be in contention for major championships. I just need to do better.\"\n\nAnother American, Ally Ewing, 31, had Sunday's best score, a 66. After opening the round 9 shots off the lead at 4 over, Ewing finished just 4 shots back.\n\n\"For any golfer, we want to peak around major championships,\" Ewing said. \"Starting the week with a 4 over and then just gradually playing the golf course better and better, executing more shots, it's just a really good feeling.\n\n\"This was where I made my first professional U.S. Open start, so really good memories for Lancaster now.\"\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report.",

            "summary": "On U.S. Women’s Open Sunday, full range of emotions on display\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare on Twitter\n\nShare by Email\n\nYuka Saso won her second U.S. Women's Open title in Lancaster — but there were plenty of players who left heartbroken. Getty Images\n\nLANCASTER, Pa. — As the final group came off the course on Sunday at the 79th U.S. Women’s Open, Minjee Lee and Andrea Lee (no relation) walked through a sea of fans gathered around the outside of the Lancaster Country Club clubhouse.\n\nMinjee walked first, staring blankly ahead, only breaking her trance to thank a fan who complimented her bright pink shirt. Andrea came next, stopping to hug Ruoning Yin before continuing on to the scoring area. Each had entered Sunday hoping to win the biggest event in women’s golf. They both came away empty-handed.\n\nAs the two Lees continued their march to the scoring tent, they passed by a collection of photographers, videographers and writers. The group was following Yuka Saso, whose two-under 68 had clinched her the second U.S. Women’s Open title of her career. She was headed to the 18th green to receive her prize — the Harton S. Semple trophy.\n\nMinjee walked by without a second glance, while Andrea stopped for a moment to take in the scene. If a few shots had happened differently, it could have been one of them commanding the attention of the hoard of media. Instead, they will each leave Lancaster ruing the what-ifs.\n\nAndrea met with the assembled media and voiced her disappointment in how she’d played. She was in contention right until the end, three untimely back-nine bogeys sinking her chances of winning the biggest tournament of her young career.\n\n“It was tough out there,” she said. “Obviously didn’t have my best right from the start. I was pretty nervous, but yeah, just didn’t have great shots out there.”\n\nComing up just short is never easy, but when it happens on Sunday, you’ve got to relive the heartache. When you come close to glory, but ultimately fail, everyone wants to know what went wrong. As Andrea spoke interviewed with Amy Rogers from the Golf Channel, tears welled in her eyes.\n\nNot far away, runner-up Hinako Shibuno spoke with the Japanese media contingent in her native tongue. The 2019 AIG Women’s Open champion has earned the nickname “Smiling Cinderella” for her megawatt smile that seemingly never leaves her face. This occasion was no different.\n\nAlthough Shibuno had also come up just short of the ultimate goal, there wasn’t the same hint of regret that followed the final pairing.\n\n“I have been very nervous all the way through,” Shibuno said. “I feel like there are some places that are a little bit regrettable, but still, I think I finished strong.”\n\nAs Shibuno played in the penultimate pairing, she watched on from the 18th fairway as Saso saved par on the final hole. As soon as the ball touched the bottom of the cup, she clapped her hands over her head in appreciation of the round her friend and competitor had put together.\n\nWhen Saso watched the ball roll into the cup, she too raised her hands in jubilation. Her final-round 68 — complete with a back-nine 32 — got her in the house at four under par. And with her nearest competitors faltering a few holes back, it was at this moment that her dreams of a second U.S. Women’s Open title became a reality. Saso insists she didn’t know where she stood on the leaderboard for most of the day, but when that par putt dropped, she knew exactly what it meant.\n\n“I wasn’t too relaxed to be able to see the scoreboard,” she said. “But like I said earlier, I just tried to be focused on my routine and my game, and I think that’s why I looked like that on TV. I think it’s a good thing that I looked like that.”\n\nWith her second Semple trophy in hand, and a little history in tow, Saso took a moment for an interview with Golf Channel on the 72nd green. Her father was alongside her for this victory, and as she spoke, tears came to her eyes.\n\n“I think winning in 2021 I represented the Philippines,” Saso said. “I feel like I was able to give back to my mom. This year I was able to represent Japan, and I think I was able to give back to my dad. I’m very happy that I was able to do it. It’s just a wonderful feeling that I was able to give back to my parents in the same way.”\n\nAs the crowds shuffled out of Lancaster Country Club, and the sun set over the hills in the distance, another major Sunday was complete. For Saso, the day ended with the highest of highs. For those who came oh so close to glory, this will be a Sunday they’d soon like to forget.\n\nNo matter the final result, the full range of emotions always comes out on the final day of a major. That much was clear on the final day of this U.S. Women’s Open.",

            "summary": "Stars coach Peter DeBoer describes his disappointment after the Stars were eliminated by the Edmonton Oilers in the Western Conference final. (1:08)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nWhen it came to what the Dallas Stars did in Game 6, captain Jamie Benn said it was likely his team's best performance of the Western Conference finals.\n\nIt was also the one that saw the Stars get eliminated in Game 6 of a West finals for the second year in a row.\n\nDespite taking three times the shots and owning the puck 75% of the time, the Stars fell short in a 2-1 loss Sunday to the Edmonton Oilers, who reached the Stanley Cup Final for the first time since 2006.\n\n\"You could probably argue that was our best game of the series,\" Benn said. \"It just didn't go our way.\"\n\nEntering Game 6, the goal for the Stars was to echo the comeback they mounted in the first round of the playoffs, when after falling to a two-game deficit against the defending Stanley Cup champion Vegas Golden Knights, Dallas ended up winning the series in seven games.\n\nThis time, the Stars grabbed a 2-1 series lead before the Oilers scored a combined eight goals in their Games 4 and 5 wins, giving them a chance to clinch in six. A Stars' victory Sunday would have forced a deciding game in Dallas, giving coach Peter DeBoer a chance to extend his record to 8-0 in Game 7s.\n\nInstead, the Stars' flight back to Dallas will start an offseason powered by the reality that they're still in a championship window.\n\n\"We went through a gauntlet and beat some really good teams and knew we had something special,\" Stars forward Tyler Seguin said. \"We lost to a team that we thought we could beat and sometimes, that's playoffs. Sometimes, it's that one bounce, that one goal, that one save. That's why we all love it. That's why it's the hardest damn trophy in the world to win.\"\n\nEdmonton had a 2-0 lead by the end of the first period after Connor McDavid deked his way to the net before firing a point-blank shot to beat Jake Oettinger, then Zach Hyman scored a power-play goal with a little more than three minutes left in the frame.\n\nNot only did the Oilers have a two-goal lead after the first, but they did it by mustering three only shots while the Stars had 12.\n\nThe Stars would finish with 35 shots, the Oilers with 10. Natural Stat Trick's metrics show that the Stars had a shot-share of 73.75% in 5-on-5 play while also racking up 10 high-danger scoring chances, something they hadn't done since Game 3.\n\nAnd they had three power-play chances, while the Oilers had just one opportunity with the extra-skater advantage.\n\nEven with their latest defeat, losing in the conference final for a second straight season strengthens the Stars' belief that they're in a championship window. The group has reached three West finals in the past five years for an organization that built its roster through the draft.\n\nBenn was among 10 players who were drafted by the Stars and played for them in Game 6. The team's younger talents include Jason Robertson, Roope Hintz, Wyatt Johnston, Thomas Harley, Oettinger and Mavrik Bourque, who made his playoff debut Sunday.\n\nThe 34-year-old Benn is one of 13 Stars players under contract for next season. Harley, as a restricted free agent, is among those who will remain under team control. Others, such as trade-deadline acquisition Chris Tanev, second-round series hero Matt Duchene and veteran forward Joe Pavelski, are unrestricted free agents.\n\n\"I believe that, yeah,\" Benn said of the Stars' setup for a strong future. \"But I'm not really thinking about it right now. This a tough time.\"\n\nSeguin, who is under contract for three more seasons, shared his reasons for optimism.\n\nHe said recent Stanley Cup champions have had to go through painful defeats before reaching their goal, noting that it took time for the Golden Knights and Tampa Bay Lightning to break through.\n\nAnother team he mentioned is the one the Oilers will face in the Stanley Cup Final: the Florida Panthers. They lost in the first round in 2019 and again in 2020 before reaching the second round in 2021 and losing, only to now be in a consecutive Cup Final for the first time in team history.\n\n\"Unfortunately, you got to lose a lot to win in this league,\" said Seguin, who won a Cup with the Boston Bruins in 2011. \"I don't know why it's like that. Learn some lessons, keep this taste and get ready for next year.\"",

            "summary": "Defenseman Ryan Suter has played 1,444 regular-season games, most among active players who have not won the Cup, and 133 playoff games. He’s 39 with one season left on his contract. Before the series, he sat next to Pavelski at a press conference and was asked about chasing the Cup.\n\n“I can’t speak for Joe, but for myself, it’s the only reason I’m playing,” said Suter, who has four kids, ages 6-13. “My kids are at the age now where I want to spend more time with them and be a part of what they’re doing, whether it’s hockey or other sports or school or whatever. But for me, that’s the reason I’m playing.\n\n“You hear so many good stories …”\n\nHis voice trailed off.\n\n“And it’s not going to define your career,” he continued. “If you don’t [win the Cup], obviously, it would [stink], but I don’t think it defines you as a player. But that’s why I’m playing.”\n\nCaptain Jamie Benn has played 1,112 regular-season and 102 playoff games, all with the Stars, without winning the Cup. He turns 35 on July 18 and has one season left on his contract.\n\nForward Matt Duchene, 33, has played 1,056 regular-season and 51 playoff games without winning the Cup. He signed a one-year contract with the Stars on July 1, mostly because he thought they gave him the best chance to win.\n\n“You want to win, but you really want to win for those older guys,” said Stars center Wyatt Johnston, a 21-year-old who lived at Pavelski’s house the past two seasons. “Yeah, it [stinks]. You want to win so bad and you want those older guys to get their Cup.”\n\nThe Stars believed they could do it. They went 52-21-9 in the regular season, winning the Western Conference and finishing one point behind the New York Rangers for the Presidents’ Trophy. They defeated the past two Stanley Cup champions: the Vegas Golden Knights (2023) in seven games in the first round and the Colorado Avalanche (2022) in six in the second.\n\nBut in the conference final, they let a couple of opportunities slip away. In Game 1, they failed to cash in on a double minor in overtime -- forward Jason Robertson hit the right goal post and then the left -- and lost 3-2 in double OT. They took a 2-0 lead in the first period of Game 4 and had a chance to take a 3-1 lead in the best-of-7 series, but they were outscored 10-2 the rest of the way.\n\nSpecial teams were a big factor. The Stars went 0-for-14 on the power play. The Oilers went 4-for-11, including 2-for-3 in Game 5 and 2-for-2 in Game 6.\n\nAfter the Oilers took a 2-0 lead in the first period of Game 6, they sat back, and the Stars carried the play. Forward Mason Marchment cut it to 2-1 at 9:18 of the third period. But despite a desperate push to the final horn, despite outshooting the Oilers 35-10, the Stars couldn’t get the tying goal.\n\nGutted. As the teams lined up for handshakes, the Stars had to hear the Edmonton fans cheering and chanting, “We want the Cup!”\n\n“Hockey’s hard, you know?” forward Tyler Seguin said. “You need a lot of things to go right. You need to have that opportunity. We had that opportunity. We went through a gauntlet, beat some really good teams and knew we had something special and lost to a team that we thought we could beat, and sometimes that’s playoffs.

Pete DeBoer’s face sank.\n\nComing this close to the Stanley Cup Final and coming up short was excruciating. Feeling like they had failed Joe Pavelski was somehow worse.\n\n“Don’t ask about Joe,” Seguin said with a sad laugh as he welled up a bit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Sunday night’s 2-1 loss to the Edmonton Oilers in Game 6 of the Western Conference final was the last game of Pavelski’s career — and it sure sounded like a real possibility based on the way his teammates spoke of him afterward — it’ll be a tough one to swallow. Pavelski had a postseason to forget, with just one goal and three assists in 19 games. The man with 1,068 career regular-season points and 143 more in the playoffs didn’t register a single one in the Oilers series.\n\nBut his impact on the Stars these last five seasons was immeasurable.\n\n“Since Day 1, since he’s been in here, he’s meant everything to our group — on the ice, off the ice, all our golf games,” Seguin said. “He’s improved all of those. Just an amazing person to have in here.”\n\nDeBoer called it “the absolute privilege of my coaching career to coach a guy like that.” Captain Jamie Benn called him an “all-time teammate.” And Johnston, who at 21 years old is barely half Pavelski’s age (the veteran turns 40 next month), was in tears when discussing the man whose family he’s lived with since entering the NHL.\n\n“I can’t thank him and his family enough for what they’ve done for me,” Johnston said.\n\nJoe Pavelski didn’t register a single point in the Stars’ playoffs series vs. the Oilers. (Leila Devlin / Getty Images)\n\nIt was another near-miss in a career full of them for Pavelski. He reached the Stanley Cup Final twice, once with the San Jose Sharks in 2016 and once with the Stars in the 2020 bubble here in Edmonton, but his teams were constantly contenders. You don’t play in 201 career playoff games by accident.\n\nAnd Pavelski’s not the only veteran who lost a golden opportunity for a first championship. Ryan Suter is 39, Benn is 34 and Matt Duchene is 33. There will be more chances for those last three, for sure, as the Stars are built for the present and the future. But this was the top team in the Western Conference, a team that checked every box with its talent, its depth, its structure, its blue line, its goaltending. It was supposed to be their year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut an 0-for-14 performance on the power play, coupled with four power-play goals allowed in Games 5 and 6, doomed them to another offseason of what-ifs. The Stars outshot the Oilers 35-10 in Game 6, the largest shot differential and the fewest shots ever allowed in a series-clinching loss. Right up until the very end, as they peppered Oilers goaltender Stuart Skinner with shots in a frantic six-on-five, they believed they would somehow win the game, the series and the Stanley Cup.\n\n“Hockey’s hard, you know?” Seguin said. “You need a lot of things to go right. You need to have that opportunity. We had that opportunity. We went through a gantlet and beat some really good teams (Vegas and Colorado) and knew we had something special. Lost to a team that we thought we could beat, and sometimes that’s the playoffs. Sometimes it’s that one bounce, one goal, one save. That’s why we all love it. That’s why this is the hardest damn trophy in the world to win.”\n\nJohnston, in just his second postseason, has years of chances ahead of him. And even if the Stars start shedding some veterans through attrition and free agency, he believes the team is well set up for future runs.\n\n“A lot of really good guys who have a lot of hockey ahead,” Johnston said. “And even our older guys have a lot of really good hockey ahead of them. It’s hard to look into the future right now and look past (tonight), but it’s definitely exciting.”\n\nSeguin was all raw emotion in the wake of the loss, a mix of appreciation and devastation. Hockey’s like that.\n\n“There’s a lot of emotion right now, a lot of disappointing, but heck yeah, (we) had a ton of fun, too,” he said. “We had a blast being in these big moments, guys grinding, and the ups and downs. I love this s—. So that was awesome. … Unfortunately, you have to lose a lot to win in this league. I don’t know why it’s like that, but (you have to) learn some lessons, keep this taste, and get ready for next year.”\n\n(Top photo of Joe Pavelski and Connor McDavid: Codie McLachlan / Getty Images)",

After two rounds of play (which each consist of multiple games), there are just eight teams left. These eight teams then head to Omaha, Neb. for the College World Series. The CWS is the culmination of the DI tournament, where the teams compete in two brackets, with the winners of each meeting in the CWS finals, a best-of-three series to decide the NCAA champion.\n\nWhen did the College World Series start?\n\nThe first-ever NCAA Division I baseball tournament was in 1947, and would barely be recognized as the same tournament nowadays. The 1947 tournament featured just eight teams, which were divided into two four-team, single-elimination brackets. The two winners — California and Yale — then met in a best-of-three final in Kalamazoo, Michigan. California would go undefeated through the inaugural CWS and beat Yale to capture the first title.\n\nHow are teams selected for the NCAA Division I baseball tournament?\n\nSince 1954, the NCAA Division I baseball tournament field has been split into two qualifying groups: The automatic berths, and the at-large selections. Since 2014, that in a typical year split sees 31 conference champions receive automatic berths, and 33 teams receive at-large bids, decided by the NCAA Division I Baseball Committee.\n\nMen's College World Series champs since 1947\n\nCalifornia defeated Yale in the first-ever Men's College World Series, the first of two played in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Texas put itself on the map as the first back-to-back champions in winning the only MCWS ever played in Wichita, Kansas in 1949. The following season Texas won its second championship, opening Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha.\n\nHere's a complete list of all the College World Series finals in the 73-year history of the event. Ole Miss won the 2022 Men's College World Series in two games over Oklahoma.",

            "summary": "SHARE\n\nHave we finally, at long last, reached the Paramount Global endgame? It’s increasingly looking that way. On Friday, word leaked that the special committee of the Paramount board of directors had recommended to Shari Redstone the deal proposed by a consortium led by David Ellison of Skydance Media and Gerry Cardinale of RedBird Capital, after the group sweetened its bid over the course of the last week. On Sunday afternoon, the Journal reported that the sweetener included an offer to buy nonvoting shares at $15 each, or the option to roll them into the new deal, a premium of about 25 percent to Friday’s close. But whether the board’s recommendation is good enough for Shari remains to be seen. She alone is the decider.\n\nIn truth, I’ve never seen so much obsessive, minute-to-minute media coverage around a deal with so little actual deal heat from potential buyers. Aside from Skydance/RedBird and Sony/Apollo—both of which have seemed somewhat indifferent to the asset at times, and keener to walk away than to complete the deal—there ain’t a whole lot of buyer interest in Paramount Global. It’s nutty, and I know I’ve done my part in contributing to the media frenzy. But I find it fascinating from an M&A point of view because it’s been such a bizarre and lengthy process, and Shari could still decide to do nothing at the end of all this mishegas, which has seen the departure of the company’s C.E.O. and four of its board members along the way. Shareholders would hate it if she walked away at this point, but she’ll probably face investor lawsuits no matter what she decides. (This is neither investment nor legal advice.)",

            "title": "As Paramount Global Preps For Shareholder Meeting And Town Hall, Details Of Revised Skydance Offer Surface",
            "summary": "As Paramount Global approaches Tuesday’s annual shareholder meeting and a high-stakes town hall for employees the following day, new details are emerging about Skydance Media‘s latest acquisition offer.\n\nThe David Ellison-led Skydance, which has been in the running for months to take control of Paramount, had sweetened its offer in recent days in order to assuage the concerns of non-voting shareholders. In the current scenario, those shareholders would be in line to receive $15 a share, a 26% premium over the company’s stock price as of Friday. Sources familiar with the discussions confirmed the proposed terms to Deadline after The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg had reported them earlier Sunday.\n\nIn a two-step transaction, Skydance would first acquire National Amusements, which controls nearly 80% of the voting shares of Paramount, though only about 10% of its equity value. The second step would see the company pump cash into Paramount, which would then acquire Skydance. Those are just the broad outlines, of course, as the specific structure of the new entity is the subject of considerable back and forth. Adding yet more intrigue was a report from the WSJ that National Amusements has received overtures from other potential acquirers, including one from producer Steven Paul valuing the company at around $3 billion.\n\nWhile many in Hollywood, among them top filmmakers like James Cameron, have come out in support of the Skydance deal, a separate scenario involving private equity behemoth Apollo Global Management and Sony Pictures Entertainment drew a lot of fans on Wall Street. Prospects of the Apollo/Sony option have seemingly dimmed in recent days. SPE chief Tony Vinciquerra told Deadline last week that talks were “progressing” between the parties but he also declined to cite Paramount or other M&A opportunities during remarks at a recent Sony investor presentation.\n\nWhile Skydance’s offer has been sweetened multiple times, and a special committee of Paramount’s board of directors has reportedly given its thumbs-up, a few sticking points remain. Perhaps the biggest is indemnification, the official term for who would back the company if shareholders or other stakeholders decide to sue over the merger. In recent months, as Skydance and its backers, including RedBird Capital, have pursued a deal, the notion of Class B (non-voting) shareholders taking National Amusements CEO Shari Redstone to court has become a realistic threat. One source told Deadline Sunday night that it could potentially derail the deal, as could haggling over a “go-shop” provision that could enable Paramount and National Amusements to seek a better offer than that from Skydance.\n\nThe New York Times reported on the remaining hurdles to a deal on Sunday.\n\nReps from Skydance, Paramount and Redstone declined comment.\n\nThe shareholder meeting and the town hall are both set to be significant moments for the three-pronged Office of the CEO installed after Bob Bakish’s ouster earlier this spring. Acquisition news is not expected to be made at the meeting, though the company’s post-Bakish strategy should become a bit more clear. Divvying up the CEO duties are Brian Robbins, President & CEO of Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon; George Cheeks, President & CEO of CBS; and Chris McCarthy, President & CEO Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and Paramount Media Networks. Each delivered brief remarks on Paramount’s quarterly earnings call in April but did not take questions from Wall Street analysts, instead promising to lay out more details soon about their strategic vision. “Soon” officially arrives this week.\n\nAt the shareholder meeting, which will be conducted virtually, the execs will deliver a presentation to investors. They are expected to expand on it on Wednesday during a town hall meeting with employees, who are eager to learn more about leadership’s plans. While Paramount’s recent history has been replete with dramatic moments, the current intrigue has taken on an existential dimension. “There’s a lot of emotion involved because of Shari’s family legacy,” one source observed. “It’s only adding to what is already a really complex financial situation to work out.”\n\nWith uncertainty clouding Paramount, having a troika at the top is also introducing new uneasiness among the rank and file. Multiple sources inside the company have described to Deadline an increasingly stressful atmosphere given the fact that three senior execs who have steadily risen through the ranks in recent years are now also responsible for the company’s Wall Street profile. As Robbins, Cheeks and McCarthy look to make a favorable impression, each has considerably more experience in the entertainment realm than with financial operations or corporate governance. As they collectively replace Bakish amid rampant speculation about the company’s future, the intensity of the effort has radiated across their respective silos.\n\nParamount’s beleaguered stock has slipped 17% this year to date as investors have fretted about its effort to profit from streaming even as linear TV continues its inexorable decline. Shares are worth about one-third what they were in 2019 after Redstone’s long-planned reunion of Viacom and CBS finally became reality.\n\nThe company did manage last month to pull off a carriage renewal with Charter, the No. 1 U.S. pay-TV operator, without the damaging blackouts that hit Disney in a tussle with Charter last summer.\n\n“We had expected to see at least some longer-tail networks get dropped, so we would consider this part a win for Paramount,” wrote MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman in a recent note to clients, adding that the financials of the agreement remain unknown. “Of course, the total rate Charter agreed to pay Paramount for the entire portfolio of networks, including CBS, Paramount+ ad-tier, Showtime linear and the cable networks, will determine the true degree of the win or loss. Keeping carriage at the expense of accepting a big discount to prior affiliate fee rates would be just as detrimental to future cash flows.”",

Finishing matches at 3 a.m. local time, she said, isn’t healthy.\n\n\"Yeah, I definitely think finishing at 3 a.m. is — I feel like a lot of times people think you're done, but really, 3 a.m., then you have [media responsibilities] and then you have to shower, eat, and then a lot of times people do treatments,\" Gauff said Sunday, via ESPN. \"So that's probably not going to bed until 5 o'clock at the earliest, maybe 6 o'clock, and even 7 o'clock.\n\n\"I definitely think it's not healthy. It may be not fair for those who have to play late because it does ruin your schedule. I've been lucky I haven't been put in a super-late finish yet.\"\n\nGauff’s comments came after her win over Elisabetta Cocciaretto, which sent her into the French Open quarterfinals for a fourth straight year. Gauff reached the finals in 2022 and fell to Iga Swiatek in straight sets. Swiatek beat her in the quarterfinals last year, too. Gauff will take on No. 8 Ons Jabeur next on Tuesday.\n\nThough she hasn’t been directly impacted by a late match yet in Paris, Novak Djokovic’s win over Lorenzo Musetti in the third round ended at 3:07 a.m. local time on Sunday. While it was a five-set thriller, it didn’t start until just after 10:30 p.m. local time. There were rain delays this weekend in Paris, which threw scheduling around.\n\nCoco Gauff will take on Ons Jabeur in the French Open quarterfinals on Tuesday.

I know on the tour side they're thinking about putting matches can't start after a certain time,\" Gauff said. \"I don't know if it's going to be a Grand Slam rule, but I know on the WTA Tour — I think that's something to look at.

            "summary": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nPARIS -- Coco Gauff said 3 a.m. finishes for matches are not \"healthy\" for players, adding that tournament organizers should consider a mandatory cutoff point for when night matches start.\n\nNovak Djokovic's third-round match Sunday at the French Open against Lorenzo Musetti ended at 3:07 a.m. local time after starting at 10:37 p.m. the previous night. The five-setter lasted 4 hours, 29 minutes.\n\nThese designated night matches are ticketed separately from the rest of the play on Court Philippe-Chatrier during the day. The evening match usually begins at 8:15 p.m. local time, but a scheduling change Sunday saw an extra match included on the main court at Roland Garros as organizers sought to complete third-round matches after rain delays.\n\nThe addition of Grigor Dimitrov's match to the Philippe-Chatrier schedule pushed Djokovic's match later into the evening, resulting in the latest finish in French Open history.\n\n\"Yeah, I definitely think finishing at 3 a.m. is -- I feel like a lot of times people think you're done, but really, 3 a.m., then you have (media responsibilities) and then you have to shower, eat, and then a lot of times people do treatments,\" Gauff said. \"So that's probably not going to bed until 5 o'clock at the earliest, maybe 6 o'clock, and even 7 o'clock.\n\n\"I definitely think it's not healthy. It may be not fair for those who have to play late because it does ruin your schedule. I've been lucky I haven't been put in a super-late finish yet.\"\n\nLate finishes are becoming increasingly common, with matches at both the Australian Open and US Open frequently going on until the early hours of the morning. Gauff said there should be a cutoff point in the evening for when matches can start.\n\n\"What can be done? I know on the tour side they're thinking about putting matches can't start after a certain time,\" Gauff said. \"I don't know if it's going to be a Grand Slam rule, but I know on the WTA Tour -- I think that's something to look at. Maybe if a match is going long, possibly moving courts. Then I know it's tough because, especially here, it's only one night match, and people obviously paid for those tickets.\n\n\"It's a complicated thing, but I definitely think for the health and safety of the players it would be in the sport's best interest I think to try to avoid those matches finishing -- or starting after a certain time. Obviously, you can't control when they finish.\"\n\nCarlos Alcaraz, the third seed in the men's draw, agreed that the late-night matches make it \"really difficult to recover.\"\n\n\"For me it's much better to finish at 6:00 (p.m.), having dinner at a good restaurant -- good food,\" he said. \"So everything is better if you finish early. The night session is a real thing, so we can't change it. We have to adapt ourselves as much as or as better as we can to the matches.\"\n\nGauff, who advanced to the French Open quarterfinals with a straight-sets victory Sunday over unseeded Italian Elisabetta Cocciaretto, also believes players should have more of a say in the scheduling of tournaments to help safeguard their welfare.\n\n\"I think that we're their product, essentially, and I definitely think -- I feel like tournaments are becoming more understanding,\" she said. \"Some tournaments are more understanding than others. It's tough, but I think tournaments ... should listen to the players more.\n\n\"I know there's a product to sell, and I know that there's certain things outside of the control. But overall, if there's a list of little things, like the balls. If there's multiple players -- and I feel like there were a lot -- complaining about the ball changing, especially on the men's side, every week, I think that's something that can be considered when it comes to tournaments and the health and safety of players.\n\n\"Obviously I don't want to complain too much about it because we are very blessed and privileged to be playing for a lot of money, and there's people working real jobs under worse conditions for less money and just trying to get by. So it's a balance between two things.\"\n\nWorld No. 1 Iga Swiatek said players ultimately will have to accept whatever decision is made by tournament organizers when it comes to night matches and late finishes.\n\n\"It's not easy to play, and then it's not like we're going to fall asleep one hour after the match,\" said Swiatek, who also won Sunday to reach the quarterfinals. \"Usually it takes us like four hours to even chill, and you need to do recovery, media. It's not like the work ends with the match point.\n\n\"I was always one of the players that said that we should start a little bit earlier. Also, I don't know if the fans are watching these matches if they have to go to work next day or something when the matches are finishing at 2 or 3 a.m. It's not up to us. We need to accept anything that is going to come to us.\"",

            "summary": "It took five months, two matches, and too much tennis that lasted into the small hours of the night. At 3:06 on Sunday morning in Paris, the version of Novak Djokovic that has become so familiar over the past decade finally emerged.\n\nWhen it was over, Djokovic gave full credit to the crowd for turning him into his old self at 2-2 in the fourth set. Before that, the 37-year-old had struggled to penetrate the aesthetic steel of 22-year-old 30th seed Lorenzo Musetti, an opponent he described as impenetrable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReally, there was one especially important person in the crowd who probably needed more credit than anyone else. That would be Djokovic’s wife, Jelena — the teenage sweetheart who turned into his life companion and stuck around through the inevitable chaos and dips of his life and their bond.\n\nAt this moment, she is just about the only person in his inner circle who has been there for the long haul, especially during the nine-month period in which he has jettisoned much of his staff for the final segment of his career.\n\nJelena Djokovic watching on (Pierre Suu/WireImage)\n\nAt a game apiece in that fourth set, he and Jelena locked eyes. The rest of the people in his box were pretty quiet, but Jelena was up on her feet, clapping her hands, making it clear her husband knew the tennis and more importantly, the drive, was still inside him — if he wanted to find it.\n\nDjokovic had just held serve. He shook his racket at her a few times, the start of a grin coming onto his face as if to tell her not to worry: he was here for it.\n\nShe got a little louder, pumping her hands with a little more. The grin turned into a full-blown smile, and he yelled to her in that language only longtime companions keep between each other.\n\nAnd then Jelena was laughing hard, clutching her fingers in front of her chin at the absurdity of it all — two now-old kids, having a late night in the City of Light, a place that long ago made the 2am jazz set famous — and as though she knew what was coming next.\n\nDjokovic knew who to credit for his victory (Emmanuel Dunand/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nBrad Stine, the longtime coach who guided Jim Courier to No 1 in the men’s rankings three decades ago, likes to talk about what he calls his “conversion theory” in tennis. Any player can turn any game, sometimes any match, around in the space of three points. That’s all it takes to shift the momentum 180 degrees, to drive an opponent from comfort and cruise control to panic and doubt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Do the math,” says Stine, who now coaches men’s world No 14 Tommy Paul. It’s all about making the scoreboard work for your brain, he says.\n\nDjokovic had made it clear to Jelena that he wasn’t going anywhere. Still, Musetti, a gifted and fluid Italian, wouldn’t catch wind of that for another two games, when he was leading 40-15, a point from being three games away from sending the defending champion and 24-time Grand Slam winner away from Court Philippe-Chatrier in defeat.\n\nGO DEEPER Novak Djokovic is counting himself out - is it for real this time?\n\nDjokovic jumped into a return, catching it four feet inside the baseline, then hit a drop shot and sent an easy volley into the open court. Musetti gifted him the next point with a double fault. Then came some deep loops to Musetti’s one-handed backhand. Before long, one of them sailed wide. Musetti would gain a momentary reprieve with a big serve that Djokovic couldn’t get back.\n\nDjokovic had to labor at times (Emmanuel Dunand/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThat got him jawing with Boris Bosnjakovic, the 50-year-old from Novi Sad in his native Serbia who has helped him scout opponents on and off but is now in his box — at least for this event — helping to fill the void left by Goran Ivanisevic’s departure in March.\n\nBosnjakovic is not the new coach. It’s a team effort from a shrunken coterie, with Jelena serving the dual roles of wife and psychologist, Djokovic would later explain. A forehand drive down the line got him to the brink, and then he completed the resurrection with a nifty backhand slice approach shot that Musetti ran for but could only send back wide.\n\nHis arms rose to the crowd, at one set of stands and then another. He took a seat on his bench, and let his lungs heave for a moment to pull in some oxygen. In this moment, at least, he’d found himself again.\n\nIt was time to run downhill. Musetti won just one more game.\n\nMusetti couldn’t convert two sets of brilliance into three (Clive Mason/Getty Images)\n\nIt might appear harsh to suggest it’s about time, not only for this tournament but for this trophyless year, but that’s pretty much how Djokovic feels about the results.\n\nThere was the semi-final drubbing from Jannik Sinner at the Australian Open; the bizarre March loss to the green and unproven Italian Luca Nardi, then the world’s 123rd ranked player, in Indian Wells, California. Casper Ruud of Norway got his first career win over him in Monte Carlo, and then he lost to Alejandro Tabilo of Chile and Tomas Machac of the Czech Republic in Rome and Geneva respectively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are all defeats that can befall a top player, have done so throughout the Open era and will continue to occur as new stars are born. But Djokovic has acquired such a sense of inevitability, hardened by his rivalry with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, whose feedback loop lifted them higher and higher above the rest of the field, that when they happen to him they are disorienting.\n\nThrough all those odd results, there have been strange moments of resignation and disinterest from a player who prides himself on his passion and his fight, on the willingness to go to dark places and endure intense discomfort to get where wants to go.\n\nHe’s been there and he’s come out the other side, surpassing the titles of Federer and Nadal, establishing himself as arguably the greatest of his era.\n\nBut that leaves him asking: where does he need to go next? What is he willing to do to get there? He hasn’t found the answers this year, not until the witching hour on the Roland Garros clay as Saturday became Sunday.\n\nWhen it was over, he told the crowd it was long past everyone’s bedtime, especially those children still sitting courtside. He said he was going to be up for a while, though. He had to shower, eat and go through the usual post-match routines. That wasn’t the real problem, however — not with the adrenaline of the moment coursing through his body.\n\nThe real problem was that all he wanted to do was party.\n\n(Top photo: Mateo Villalba/Getty Images)",

            "summary": "In the conclusion of Lifetime’s “The Life & Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson” docuseries, filmmakers turned their focus to the aftermath of Brown Simpson’s death at 35.\n\nAs detailed in Saturday's first chapter, O.J. Simpson’s ex-wife and her friend, Ron Goldman, were stabbed to death outside of her Brentwood home on June 12, 1994. The following year, Simpson was tried for their murders and acquitted in a televised reading of the verdict watched by an estimated 150 million people.\n\n“She’s that picture of mom of the year,” Brian \"Kato\" Kaelin says in the docuseries, referencing Brown Simpson's two children with O.J., Sydney and Justin. Kaelin memorably testified during the eight-month trial, as he was living in Simpson’s guest house at the time of her death.\n\nKris Jenner, who became good friends with Nicole because her first husband, Robert Kardashian, was close with Simpson, says she continues to grieve her 30 years later. “You never get over losing a friend that way, and I think I pack it down so far deep inside,” she says of “one of the worst days I’ve ever experienced.”\n\nHere are the biggest revelations from the second half of “The Life & Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson.”\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nShocking revelationsfrom 'Life & Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson' Lifetime documentary\n\nAt Nicole’s visitation, her mom asked O.J., ’Did you do this?’\n\nDominique Brown — who participated in the docuseries with her sisters Denise and Tanya Brown — says Simpson asked her to accompany him as he paid his respects to Nicole at a visitation. “He grabbed my hand, and he took me over to Nicole, and we knelt there with Nicole,” Dominique says, beginning to cry. “And I knelt there with him in front of my dead sister.”\n\nNicole’s friend, Robin Greer, remembers Simpson standing over the casket and repeatedly apologizing, saying, “I’m so sorry. Nic, I’m so sorry.” Greer says Simpson also extended an apology to her. “He was just admitting that he did it, and he’s sorry,” Greer assesses.\n\nBrown family friend D'Anne Purcilly says that, at the visitation, Nicole’s mother, Juditha Brown, asked Simpson directly, “Did you do this?\"\n\nSimpson then looked down, Purcilly recalls, and said, \"'Dita, I loved her. I just loved her too much.’ I was like, 'He’s going to tell her he did it.' He didn’t. He just kept saying, over and over again, ‘I loved her too much.’”\n\nDominique’s complicated feelings about the shocking verdict: ‘Did you really want him to be guilty?’\n\nWhile Tanya and Denise hold Simpson responsible for Nicole’s death, Dominique is unsure of his culpability.\n\n“I knew that somebody was to blame, and I knew that somehow there was involvement\" by Simpson, she says. “I didn’t know to what extent. I still don’t know.”\n\nDominique says she experienced an array of emotions when the not-guilty verdict was read. “I was shocked. I don’t know. Relieved, disappointed, angry,\" she says. \"I mean, did you really want him to be guilty? Did you not want him to be guilty? It’s a tough question.”\n\nNicole Brown Simpson's sisters remember'adventurous' spirit before meeting O.J. Simpson\n\nConversations with Sydney Simpson about OJ's involvement in her mother’s death\n\nDenise says that, after his arrest, Sydney, then 8 or 9, expressed concerns that her father would be executed. As Denise tucked her into bed, Sydney asked, “’Is my daddy going to die?’ And I said, 'No,'” Denise remembers. Why did she ask? “’Well, don’t they put people who kill other people — don’t they kill them?’ And I said, ‘They’ve already said that they’re not going to do that, Sydney.’”\n\nPurcilly says she also had a difficult conversation with Sydney after the child visited Michael Jackson’s Neverland Ranch with Simpson. Sydney asked Purcilly if her kids could join them sometime.\n\n“I sat down with her,” says Purcilly, “and I said, ‘Sydney, you have to understand that I will never let my boys go be with your dad. Because I believe your dad killed your mother, and I can’t let my children go there. She just kind of looked at me and said, ‘Yeah. Yeah, I know.’ And she got up, and she ran out of the room.”\n\n‘A series’ of calls made reporting violence in the Simpson home after kids moved to Florida\n\nSimpson relocated to Florida with Sydney and Justin in 2000, but trouble followed their family. A distressed Sydney called Miami-Dade police in 2003 after reportedly getting into an argument with Simpson. The 17-year-old requested intervention for abuse. But Simpson's attorney, Yale Galanter, denied any incident to The Associated Press and said Simpson wasn’t home when Sydney called 9-1-1.\n\nAnd it wasn’t the only call for help. A docuseries producer surprised Denise when he informed her filmmakers discovered about 17 police reports of alleged incidents in Florida.\n\n“There was a series of 9-1-1 calls about violence inside the house,” a producer says off camera, adding the calls were made anonymously. Law enforcement “couldn’t do anything because they couldn’t determine whether there was any truth to it,” the producer adds.",

Simpson, including one instance during his first date with ex-wife Nicole in the late 1970s.\n\nNicole met O.J. in 1977 when she was 18 and working as a hostess at a Los Angeles restaurant. At the time, O.J. was still married to ex-wife Marguerite Whitley, but reportedly began courting Nicole immediately.\n\nIn the first episode of the docuseries, a friend of Nicole’s recalls noticing something off about Nicole’s pants after her first date with O.J., then 30.\n\n“When she came home, her pants were ripped… zipper was ripped,” says D’Anne Purcilly, whose then-husband David LeBon allowed Nicole to stay with him while she was living in Los Angeles. “And they were jeans. And David’s like ‘You can’t just rip jeans like a linen something.’”\n\nLebon says in the docuseries that he then questioned Nicole about what had happened.\n\n“I said ‘Nicole what happened to you?’ She said ‘He got a little forcible.’ And I said ‘Why would you let him do that to you?'\"\n\nAccording to Purcilly, LeBon was “really upset” and wanted to “kind of have a few words” with O.J.\n\n“And [Nicole] said ‘No, don’t. I really like him. I really, really like him.’” Purcilly recalls. “She fell in love with him I think the first time she met him.”\n\nBut according to Nicole’s three sisters, who share her story in the docuseries, she spent the majority of her seven-year marriage to O.J. smiling to mask the pain of verbal and physical abuse. The torment was vividly revealed to the world during O.J.’s trial for the 1994 murders of Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman.\n\nNicole Brown Simpson.

He lived the rest of his days in infamy until his death from cancer on April 10.\n\nThe docuseries features interviews with 50 people, including Nicole's sisters, other family members and friends, as well as never-before-seen footage of her.\n\nIf you are experiencing domestic violence, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233, or go to thehotline.org.

Exclusive home videos give a rare glimpse into the life of a woman who was all but forgotten during the 1995 “Trial of the Century,” in which Simpson was acquitted of killing his ex-wife and Goldman.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nWhen the doc’s executive producer Melissa Moore met Denise Brown a decade ago, she approached her about working on a project that honored Nicole.\n\n“I would say to Denise, ‘I really don’t know anything about Nicole,'” recalls Moore. “I told her that we really should do something to bring awareness to who she was because if you close your eyes and try to think of her voice you can’t.”\n\nDenise, who had been approached on numerous occasions about making a documentary about Nicole, was hesitant. She didn’t want the doc to be all about O.J. But last year Moore was able to gain Denise and her siblings’ trust, and together they began working on “The Life and Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson.” (The Brown sisters did not serve as producers on the project.)\n\nThe docuseries, which originally started out as a project that would involve Nicole’s children Sydney and Justin, now 38 and 35 years-old, morphed into telling Nicole’s life story via family, friends and unseen archival materials of her childhood as well as her adult life.\n\nVariety spoke to Denise, Dominique and Tanya Brown.\n\nThere have been many docs made about O.J. and Nicole, including the ESPN docuseries “OJ: Made in America,” which won the Oscar for best feature documentary in 2017. Now there is this highly anticipated docu. What do you attribute the ongoing fascination around the case to?\n\n\n\nDenise: I think the fascination around Nicole is because people don’t know who Nicole was. They only know him (O.J.). It was always about him. It was always about the trial. People don’t understand that this was a woman and her friend (Goldman) who were murdered in the most horrific way and then they were put down so much. They were just described so poorly and so ugly and so nasty. But that was to try to get somebody off going to prison. People need to understand that these were real people. Loving wonderful people who had families and who were loved and who were fun loving.\n\nDominique, in the documentary you mention that you and Denise didn’t speak for years because you thought that by her speaking out against O.J. during the trial and her activism around domestic violence post trial it put a spotlight on Nicole’s children, who don’t like media attention. How do you feel about this doc coming out in terms of them and the media attention it could lead to for them?\n\nDominique: We have been transparent with them and have been communicating with them, so they know about (this documentary). I stay in communication with the kids a lot. I know what’s going on in their lives, except for that I didn’t know how ill their father was. That came as a shock. But we have been totally transparent with them as far as this documentary being a beautiful portrayal of their mother and that it was made to humanize her. Her love for her children shines through.\n\nWhen O.J. Simpson died in April, did any of you feel relief?\n\nTanya: No. I was sad. I was really sad. It was just different emotions. I went over to Minnie’s (Dominique) and we cried and we hugged. Then what came after that was kind of acceptance.\n\nDominique: It was very complicated. It was very confusing. Naturally everybody was responding in different ways on social media and asking if you are okay? What’s happening? One person said, “Maybe you all can move on from this now,” but my heart was with Sydney and Justin. That’s where my heartache and my tears came from.\n\nFifty people were interviewed for this documentary. Did you all have say over who was and who was not interviewed?\n\nDenise: Yes. We did. What I wanted to see in this documentary was not the same people that always talk (about this case). That was really, really important to us because it was about telling new stories and having Nicole in a new light.\n\nI was surprised that Faye Resnick was interviewed for the doc given her relationship to the case in terms of the book she wrote four months after Nicole’s murder and the archival clip in the film where, Denise, you roll your eyes when she is mentioned.\n\nDenise: At one point, I said, no, I don’t want Faye Resnick to be a part of it. I also didn’t want (Nicole’s former boyfriend) Keith (Zlomsowitch) to be a part of it, because I thought that was going to take it in a negative direction. But you know what? Everything that Faye said in it is absolutely beautiful about Nicole. I’m really, really happy that she is a part of it and that she told some wonderful stories about their friendship.\n\nDominique: The way that Lifetime had explained it to us was that there were a lot of gaps. There was a period of time — Nicole growing up in Germany and Laguna — that we had a lot of stories about . But there was a period of time when Nicole was in L.A. where she would entertain people and have dinner parties and things at her house and Faye was one of the people that was included in that. So, Faye brought life to and a different perspective to a part of Nicole life when she was (living) in her freedom.\n\nIn an archival clip in the film O.J. tells Denise that he essentially funded your parents life. During the trial that was the narrative. Is there any truth to that?\n\nDominique: O.J. was very charismatic, and very friendly. He became part of the family right away. We did everything together as a family.\n\nDenise: But money wasn’t a part of that.",

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nOn June 12, 1994, Brown Simpson was killed at her home in Brentwood, California, alongside her friend, Ronald Goldman. Her ex-husband, former NFL player OJ Simpson, was accused and later acquitted of the crime in a highly publicized trial the following year. In a civil lawsuit in 1997, he was found liable for both deaths.\n\nBrown Simpson was married to the football star turned actor for seven years between 1985 and 1992. According to the docuseries, she met him in 1977 when she was just 18. At the time, Simpson was still married to his first wife, Marguerite Whitley, with whom he shared three children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTogether, Brown Simpson and Simpson — who died of metastatic prostate cancer on April 10 at the age of 76 — had two children of their own: a daughter named Sydney Brooke Simpson, who was born in 1985, and a son named Justin Ryan Simpson, who was born in 1988.\n\nThey were eight and five, respectively, when their mother died. The pair, now in their late 30s, have chosen not to participate in the docuseries.\n\nHowever, the project features interviews with 50 people who knew Brown Simpson well, including her sisters, Denise, Dominique, and Tanya Brown, and close friends, Kris Jenner, Faye Resnick, and Brian \"Kato\" Kaelin.\n\nHere's where Brown Simpson's children are today and what happened to them after their mother's death and father's trial.",

            "summary": "TAIWAN – Lifelike \"digital humans\" that will serve as everything from your nurse to your interior decorator. Virtual fashion models. A digital simulation of the entire earth.\n\nThose were just a few of the products and ideas floated by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during his keynote address at the 2024 Taipei International Information Technology Show, better known as Computex. Huang enthralled a packed house with the claim that the world has entered a \"new industrial revolution.\"\n\n\"In the future, Taiwan will build computers that walk,\" Huang said as he showed images of nine humanoid robots and several wheeled robots while emphasizing that this robotic \"future\" is already here.\n\nThe possibilities are endless, he said. Artificial Intelligence will create AI teams with an \"agent\" that interacts with you. The \"agent,\" however, is a combination of dozens of different types of generative AIs. Artificial intelligence that masters the laws of physics. A new computer board with a chip called Blackwell so fast it makes a mockery of Moore’s Law.\n\nIn a talk that lasted nearly two hours, Huang spoke passionately about how radically different \"the generative computing era\" will be from the past. Much of the tech talk was incomprehensible to non-experts, but the overall message was clear: the computing world has been mostly running on ideas that are 60 years old. But, after 20 years of work in collaboration with other Taiwanese tech giants such as TSMC, Nvidia and its partners have reinvented the computing wheel. No more info retrieval. Instead, when you want info, it will be generated – thus being more relevant and up-to-date than anything that can be \"found.\"\n\nHuang showed off four new \"AI laptops,\" and spoke about the next wave of AI: Physical AIs. These will include robots that learn in a virtual world that simulates the laws of physics, teaching the robot to flawlessly act in the real world. \"In the future, anything that moves will be automated,\" said a voiceover in one of the videos Huang showed. But he stressed that \"the future\" isn’t some abstract idea, noting that everything he had shown is currently in development. Huang spoke of \"robotic factories\" being created in Taiwan now by companies such as Foxconn, the world’s largest electronics maker.\n\nWatching Huang’s presentation offered a great deal of validation to the fears that AI and robots will take or replace human jobs, and perhaps humans themselves. But Huang sees a bright future as we break free of CPUs and enter a \"tectonic shift\" that includes something called \"the omniverse.\"\n\nMOST AMERICANS EXPECT AI ABUSES TO IMPACT 2024 ELECTION: SURVEY\n\nHuang is immensely popular in Taiwan. Since he arrived in Taipei on May 26 he’s been hounded by packs of somewhat aggressive reporters. When leaving a dinner with some of the richest tech titans on the planet, Huang hopped into a regular yellow taxicab, not some chauffeured limo.\n\nFORMER OPENAI BOARD MEMBER REVEALS WHY SAM ALTMAN WAS OUSTED LAST NOVEMBER\n\nLocal newspapers use terms like \"rockstar\" to describe him, while another common comparison is to Steve Jobs. Like Jobs, Huang understands the power of a \"look,\" almost always wearing his trademark black leather jacket, despite temperatures in Taiwan this time of year hovering around 85 degrees.\n\nJobs, however, was called \"difficult\" by even close friends and had a reputation for being somewhat aloof and inaccessible. In this regard, Huang couldn’t be more different. He’s self-deprecating, especially about his language skills, despite apparently being relatively fluent in Mandarin Chinese. During the Computex presentation, he told the crowd he’d like to speak in Chinese but that his brain couldn’t run that fast so he’d stick to English, which he mostly did while getting in plenty of well-timed Chinese one-liners as well as several sentences in Taiwanese (or Hokkien, a local language spoken by some 70% of Taiwanese).\n\nELON MUSK'S XAI GETS $6B IN NEW FUNDING AND ANNOUNCES VALUATION\n\nHuang ended his address with a tribute to Taiwan, \"the unsung hero of the coming AI industrial revolution.\" His praise for his birthplace of Taiwan was, of course, popular with the crowd and those watching the livestream of the event, but Huang has used both words and deeds to demonstrate his sincerity.\n\nJust before throwing out the ceremonial first pitch at a Saturday game between two of Taiwan’s professional baseball teams, Huang told the media, \"This is a very exciting time for Taiwan… We are at the beginning of a new age of computing, the age of AI, and Taiwan is at the center.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nHuang has repeatedly touted the overachieving, underappreciated nation of Taiwan.\n\n\"Taiwan is one of the most important countries in the world. It is at the center of the electronics industry. The computer industry is built because of Taiwan, so it’s a very, very important country,\" he told a local reporter who asked for a comment as Huang was buying snacks at a night market in Taipei.\n\nHuang repeated the word, country, not \"area,\" \"region,\" or some other generic neutral geographic moniker. His comments became headline news in Taiwan, and few think Huang misspoke. As Huang showed the 100-plus \"countries and regions\" that are working with Nvidia and other Taiwan tech companies to create this new future, one large area was not shaded green: The People’s Republic of China.",

It was dubbed by Nvidia at the time as the “world’s most powerful chip.”\n\nThe Rubin will feature new graphics processing units (GPUs), a new central processing unit (CPU) called Vera and advanced networking chips, Huang said in an address at National Taiwan University in Taipei.\n\n“Today, we’re at the cusp of a major shift in computing,” Huang told the audience ahead of the opening of Computex, a tech trade show organized annually in Taiwan. “The intersection of AI and accelerated computing is set to redefine the future.”\n\nHe revealed a roadmap for new semiconductors that will arrive on a “one-year rhythm.”\n\nInvestors have been driving up shares in chip firms riding the generative AI boom. Shares of Nvidia, the market leader, have more than doubled over the past year.\n\n“Nvidia clearly intends to keep its dominance for as long as possible and in the current generation, there is nothing really on the horizon to challenge that,” said Richard Windsor, founder of Radio Free Mobile, a research company focusing on the digital and mobile ecosystem.\n\nNvidia accounts for around 70% of AI semiconductor sales. But competition is growing, with major competitors AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) introducing new products in an effort to challenge Nvidia’s dominance.\n\nOn Monday, AMD CEO Lisa Su unveiled the company’s latest AI processors in Taipei and a plan to develop new products over the next two years.\n\nIts next generation MI325X accelerator will be made available in the fourth quarter of this year, she said.\n\nNumber one priority\n\nThe global competition to create generative AI applications has led to soaring demand for the cutting edge chips used in data centers to support these programs.\n\nBoth Nvidia and AMD, which are run by CEOs who are part of the same Taiwanese family, were once best known by gamers for selling GPUs that display visuals in video games, helping them come to life.\n\nWhile the two still compete in that space, their GPUs are now also being used to power generative AI, the technology that underpins newly popular systems such as ChatGPT.\n\n“AI is our number one priority, and we’re at the beginning of an incredibly exciting time for the industry,” Su added.\n\n“We launched MI300X last year with leadership inference performance, memory size and compute capabilities, and we have now expanded our roadmap so it’s now on an annual cadence, that means a new product family every year,” she said.\n\nThe new chip will succeed the MI300 and feature more memory, faster memory bandwidth and better computer performance, Su added. The company will launch a new product family every year, with the MI350 set for 2025 and MI400 a year later.\n\nIntel is also expected to launch its next-generation desktop CPUs, Arrow Lake, in the fourth quarter of this year. Its CEO, Patrick Gelsinger, is due to speak at Computex on Tuesday.",

Indian music label T-Series, which uploads trailers and music videos, held the record for the largest YouTube channel for five years, before it was toppled on Sunday. MrBeast, real name Jimmy Donaldson, was already the individual with the largest following. But the 26-year-old has now made history on the platform with a seemingly unassailable 269 million subscribers, dethroning T-Series and putting him head and shoulders above everything else.\n\nAcross nearly 800 videos MrBeast has made a name for himself with massive stunts - including giving away private islands, being buried alive, and staging a real-life version of the Netflix hit Squid Game. In a post on X, MrBeast said he had finally \"avenged\" YouTube star Felix Kjellberg, known as PewDiePie, in surpassing T-Series' 266m subscriber count. In a follow-up post, MrBeast said his channel took the record with its largest ever daily spike in subscribers, which rose by more than 2 million on Saturday. T-Series originally set the record in 2019 by overtaking PewDiePie - to which the Swedish YouTuber said \"all it took was a massive corporate entity with every song in Bollywood\" in a music video explaining his defeat.\n\nAllow Twitter content?

But now that honor belongs to YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson, who posted yesterday that his MrBeast YouTube operation had ‘avenged’ PewDiePie by overtaking T-Series.\n\nDonaldson made a big show of supporting Kjellberg’s campaign to stay on top back in 2019, having plastered every billboard in his town with ads promoting PewDiePie. He also showed up to the Super Bowl with several friends who wore shirts that together spelled out “SUB 2 PEW DIE PIE.” Given his 2-million-subscriber gain yesterday — a number it recently took T-Series a month to accumulate — it seems unlikely that T-Series will be able to catch up.",

            "summary": "NEW YORK -- — Ketel Marte hit a leadoff homer and then a go-ahead, two-run shot in the ninth inning that lifted the Arizona Diamondbacks over the New York Mets 5-4 on Sunday for a four-game split.\n\n“The team needs me,” Marte said. “When I play good, we’re going to win a lot of games.”\n\nBrandon Nimmo and J.D. Martinez combined to drive in three runs with consecutive triples in a four-run third against Arizona starter Brandon Pfaadt, but the Mets lost for the sixth time since May 1 when leading after eight innings.\n\nEntering the day, no other team in the majors had lost more than twice during that stretch when taking a lead into the ninth.\n\nPinch-hitter Gabriel Moreno doubled to open the ninth against left-hander Jake Diekman (1-2), and the switch-hitting Marte followed with a 439-foot drive deep into the center-field batter's eye for his 12th home run this season and seventh career multi-homer game. It was Arizona’s first hit in eight at-bats with runners in scoring position.\n\n“I don't think I'm executing well enough in certain situations,” Diekman said.\n\nMarte also homered to center off lefty Jose Quintana on the game's third pitch. Marte has a .311 batting average with nine homers and 17 RBI in 90 at-bats hitting right-handed and a .245 average with three homers and 15 RBI in 143 at-bats batting left-handed.\n\n“At some point you were going to run into a matchup that you didn’t want. Didn’t work,” Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said.\n\nJustin Martínez (2-0) tossed two hitless innings and Paul Sewald, pitching on consecutive days for the first time this year, got three outs for his fifth save.\n\n“It’s a big win,” Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said. “We’re going to feel good about traveling back to AZ and sleep well.”\n\nNew York (24-35) fell 11 games under .500, matching its season high, and finished a 3-7 homestand against three NL West opponents. The Mets have not won a series since a two-game, rain-shortened sweep at St. Louis on May 6-7 and have not won a home series since sweeping three games against Pittsburgh from April 15-17.\n\nFans booed loudly when Mark Vientos hit a game-ending popout.\n\n\"We've got to play better, especially here at home, especially in front of our fan base,\" Mendoza said.\n\nDefending NL champion Arizona won its second straight after a five-game losing streak. The Diamondbacks got solo homers from two of their first three batters against Quintana. Marte hit his fourth leadoff homer this year and the ninth of his career, and Lourdes Gurriel Jr. also went deep. Kevin Newman added an RBI grounder in the second for a 3-0 lead.\n\nQuintana allowed four runs, three hits, three walks and two hit batters in four innings, raising his ERA to 5.17. He is winless in his past nine starts and has allowed 11 homers in 12 outings this season, up from five over 13 games in his injury-shortened 2023 season.\n\nPfaadt gave up four runs and five hits in six innings.\n\nGiven a three-run lead, Pfaadt allowed Tyrone Taylor’s leadoff double in the third, a walk and Pete Alonso’s RBI single. Nimmo hit a drive to right-center that drove in two runs when right fielder Randal Grichuk just missed on his attempt for a diving backhand catch. Martinez followed two pitches later with a drive off the wall. Corbin Carroll, playing in shallow center, couldn’t sprint back quickly enough.\n\nNew York had three triples in the series after hitting one in its first 55 games.\n\nNew catcher Luis Torrens, acquired from the Yankees on Friday, went 0 for 2 with a walk in his Mets debut.\n\nTRAINER’S ROOM\n\nDiamondbacks: SS Geraldo Perdomo (right meniscus tear) will play a third game in the Arizona Complex League on Monday, then could shift his rehab assignment to Triple-A Reno. ... OF Alek Thomas (strained left hamstring) still isn’t ready for a minor league rehab assignment. ... LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (strained shoulder) is being progressed slowly in throwing on flat ground. Lovullo said a timeline for a return could be before or after the All-Star break.\n\nMets: C Francisco Alvarez (left thumb surgery) caught for the second straight day at Double-A Binghamton, playing seven innings and going 1 for 3. He could be activated for next weekend’s series against Philadelphia in London or for the homestand that opens June 11.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nDiamondbacks: RHP Ryne Nelson (3-4, 6.02 ERA) starts at home Monday night against San Francisco.\n\nMets: RHP Tylor Megill (0-2, 1.69 ERA) starts Monday night’s series opener at Washington, which opens with LHP MacKenzie Gore (4-4, 2.91).\n\n------\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",

            "title": "MLB Scores: Diamondbacks 5, Mets 4—Mets suffer another crushing defeat",
            "summary": "The Mets came into the final game of the series against the Diamondbacks looking for a win. They had not won a series at home since April, and they had two good games to start the series. José Quintana was starting for the Mets and he’s been struggling a bit this year,especially with home runs. But Brandon Pfaadt, the Diamondbacks starter, was also not lighting the world on fire, so it was a winnable game. It was also Lou Gehrig Day, which celebrates Gehrig’s life and career while also raising awareness for ALS, the disease that tragically took his life.\n\nQuintana looked shaky to start things off. He gave up a home run to Ketel Marte to lead off the game with a one-run deficit. Two batters later Lourdes Gurriel Jr. hit a one-out home run to double the Diamondbacks’ lead. Quintana got out of his mess after that but the Mets were immediately attempting a comeback. In the bottom of the first, Brandon Pfaadt sent the Mets down in order, keeping the Mets down two runs.\n\nThe second inning was not an improvement on the first for Quintana. Eugenio Suárez led off with a walk, and Blaze Alexander doubled to put two runners in scoring position. Kevin Newman grounded out but that brought in the third run for the Diamondbacks. Other than hitting Ketel Marte with a pitch with two outs, Quintana escaped the inning without giving up another run. In the bottom of the inning, the Mets struck out three times in a row, keeping them behind.\n\nThe top of the third was, comparatively, better for Quintana. He didn’t allow any runs, and other than hitting Randal Grichuk with a pitch, he got three outs fairly quickly. The Mets found some offense in the bottom of the third. Tyrone Taylor led off with a double, and moved to third on a Jeff McNeil fly out. New Met Luis Torrens walked to put two runners on the corners. Lindor lined out to Newman for the second out, but a Pete Alonso single drove in Taylor for the Mets first run and moved Torrens to second. Brandon Nimmo then hit a triple to center, driving in both Torrens and Alonso to tie the game. Then J.D. Martinez hit another triple to drive in Nimmo and give the Mets the lead. DJ Stewart struck out to end the inning but the Mets had found themselves with a skinny one run lead a third of the way through the game.\n\nQuintana had another busy inning in the fourth. Kevin Newman hit a one-out single to put a runner on, then Ketel Marte and Carroll drew back-to-back walks to load the bases with two outs. But Gurriel flew out to end the inning before Quintana could relinquish the Mets’ lead. In the bottom of the inning a Mark Vientos leadoff walk led nowhere as Taylor popped out and McNeil grounded into a double play.\n\nThe Mets made a pitching change before the start of the fifth, bringing in Dedniel Núñez to take over from Quintana. And it paid off, as other than a one-out Grichuk double, the Diamondbacks were unable to get anything going offensively. Similarly, the Mets were quiet in the bottom of the fifth, going down in order.\n\nAfter getting Newman to strike out to start the sixth, the Mets made a pitching change, bringing in Danny Young after Núñez got four outs. And other than a Ketel Marte double, Young similarly shut down the Diamondbacks. In the bottom of the sixth, the Mets were quiet, other than a DJ Stewart two-out double, and the Mets were continuing to hold a small one run lead into the final third of the game (which is a statement that has produced a lot of horror shows for the Mets over the last few weeks).\n\nReed Garrett came in to pitch in the top of the seventh, and the Mets also kept Harrison Bader (who pinch-ran for Stewart the previous inning) in to play center field, shifting Taylor to right field. Garrett had a big inning, getting three strikeouts to set the side down in order, impressive especially with his struggles as of late. The Diamondbacks brought in Justin Martinez to pitch in the bottom of the seventh, ending Pfaadt’s day after six innings. The Mets hit three consecutive groundouts, ending the inning quickly.\n\nAdam Ottavino came in to pitch the eighth inning. He looked incredibly sharp, striking out two in a perfect inning, keeping the Mets in the lead with just one more inning to go. In the bottom of the inning the Mets did nothing, with Lindor, Alonso, and Nimmo all striking out. The Mets had to just get three more outs without giving up a run to win their first series at home since April.\n\nJake Diekman came in to try and get the save for the Mets…and it didn’t quite work out. Gabriel Moreno came in to pinch-hit for Tucker Barnhart, and he led off with a double. Then Ketel Marte capped off a great day with a two-run, go-ahead home run. Diekman got Carroll to ground out for the first out, then Mendoza brought in Sean Reid-Foley to try and close out the inning. He got the job done, despite a two-out single, and the Mets were faced with having to try and win this game with just three outs to work with. And they would have to do it against former Met Paul Sewald. And two pop outs and a strikeout later, the Mets had lost to the Diamondbacks.\n\nThe Mets split with the Diamondbacks, but the obvious issues with the team persist. They have starting pitching that tends to either not be able to go long or give up a ton of runs (and sometimes both), their offense is inconsistent and the veterans especially have been struggling for large swaths of the season, and their bullpen is fatigued from having to make up for the starters’ flaws and is beginning to show large cracks. It’s still early, but the further they slip in the wild card standings, the harder it will be to catch up at a certain point.

            "title": "New York Rangers' 'special' season comes to unexpected end",
            "summary": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nSUNRISE, Fla. -- The New York Rangers didn't see this end coming.\n\nThey were the Presidents' Trophy winners on the strength of a 114-point regular season. They breezed by the Washington Capitals and defeated the Carolina Hurricanes handily to reach an Easten Conference final against the Florida Panthers.\n\nBut that's where it all fell apart for the Rangers, who lost 2-1 in Game 6 of their series on Saturday night, eliminated from the postseason in the third round for the second time in three seasons.\n\n\"What we built as a team here, it just felt special this year,\" Rangers captain Jacob Trouba said. \"It felt like we had something in this room. It was a bond. [It's] probably too soon to elaborate more.\"\n\nTrouba, in particular, came under fire for his performance on Saturday. New York's rugged defenseman misread a play at his team's blue line late in the first period, allowing Evan Rodrigues to feed Sam Bennett for Florida's opening score.\n\nThat was Bennett fourth goal in the series, tying teammate Matthew Tkachuk's franchise record for most markers in a conference final in Panthers' history. His three-game goal streak also tied a Panthers playoff record.\n\nTrouba's slow reaction contributed to the Rangers being in an early deficit they never overcame. Vladimir Tarasenko scored his first goal of the conference final -- against the veteran's former team to boot -- midway through the third period to give Florida a 2-0 lead.\n\nBy the time Artemi Panarin notched his first of the series -- with New York having already pulled goalie Igor Shesterkin -- there was just 1:39 remaining. Too little, too late from one of the Rangers' stars who had failed when it mattered most.\n\nIt wasn't just Panarin, though. Mika Zibanejad didn't score against Florida. He and Chris Kreider -- who had one short-handed tally in the series -- combined for only three shots in Game 6. And while Panarin broke through eventually, his line with Vincent Trocheck -- who led the Rangers in postseason points with 20 -- and Alexis Lafreniere were stymied by the Panthers all night.\n\nNew York lost on Saturday its third straight game by a single goal. Shesterkin's excellence -- he posted a .935 save percentage and a 2.25 goals-against average in the series -- simply wasn't enough to continually overcome the Rangers' inability to get pucks past the Panthers.\n\n\"[After] one-goal games, you think about every little play, every missed opportunity, every mistake,\" defenseman Adam Fox said. \"It hurts. When games are that tight, it sits with you, every little play you maybe could've done differently.\"\n\nShesterkin earned accolades from both dressing rooms following the loss, and Florida's coach Paul Maurice compared the goalie's showing to a legendary run from the NHL's Hart Trophy winner in 2002.\n\n\"I haven't seen a series by a goaltender like that since [former Montreal Canadiens goaltender] Jose Theodore in 2002,\" Maurice said. \"He was brilliant in this series. He was pretty good.\"\n\nIt was the rest of New York's lineup not providing enough backup. The Rangers never found the right formula to rattle Florida. And New York's momentum-sucking power play didn't help matters. The Rangers were 0-for-1 with the extra man in Game 6 and 1-for-15 in the series, a long drop from the club which held the league's third-best power play in the regular season (26.4%) and entered the series even better (at 29.7% in the playoffs).\n\nNew York stumbled too often. And there was no comeback magic left in the Rangers -- despite them having earned an NHL-record 34 come-from-behind victories in the regular season and six more in the postseason.\n\n\"They got to their game more consistently,\" Kreider said. \"They were dialed in on what they were doing.\"\n\nThe loss could signal changes for the Rangers. It's an unsettling feeling for New York to sit with given the promise of this season and how swiftly it ended with a thud.\n\n\"The culture we built here, the camaraderie, that's something we're going to have to turn over,\" Fox said. \"It sucks to think this year is over, but what we built is strong.\"\n\nNew York hoped to be heading home for a Game 7. Instead it will return with unanswered questions about what's next.\n\n\"Our guys fought this year; they bought in right from the start,\" coach Peter Laviolette said. \"We make it to this point and it's disappointing. When you start something like this ... you do it to go the whole way. So there's a disappointment right now that sets in with our group and our intentions we had throughout the year. Nobody was expecting to be on this end of it.\"",

It hasn't reached the Stanley Cup Final since 2014 and has not won the Cup since 1994.\n\nThe Rangers (55-23-4) finished first in the Metropolitan Division and won the Presidents' Trophy with an NHL-best 114 points in the regular season.

Relied too much on Shesterkin\n\nIgor Shesterkin was the Rangers’ best player. He was arguably the best player in the series for either team. Usually when that happens, that goalie's team has a great chance to win and advance. But the Rangers were unable. Shesterkin was, in fact, the reason they weren't eliminated sooner than Game 6. New York was outshot 34-24 in Game 6 and 202-151 in the series. The Panthers had a 468-372 advantage in shot attempts in the series. The Rangers did not have the puck enough for long stretches to advance. When they did, they didn't do enough with it. They couldn't score enough, mustering 12 goals in six games. And when Florida had the puck, Shesterkin had to be brilliant. Had he not been, it easily could have been over in five games, if not four.\n\n2. Power play went cold\n\nThe Rangers’ success on the power play started to tail off in the second round, when they went 1-for-10 in Games 3-6. They couldn't get it going against the Panthers either; New York was 1-for-15 on the power play in the conference final and 2-for-25 in its last 10 games of the playoffs after clicking at 40.0 percent through its first six games, all wins. The Rangers had one opportunity with the man-advantage in Game 6 and managed one non-descript shot on goal and two shot attempts. Not surprisingly, their goals per game in the playoffs dropped from 3.83 in their first six games to 2.40 in their last 10, including 2.00 in the conference final.",

(Photo by Codie McLachlan/Getty Images) Getty Images\n\nIn his ninth NHL season, Connor McDavid is about to get his first chance to play for the Stanley Cup.\n\nOn Sunday, the Edmonton Oilers captain opened the scoring in Game 6 of the Western Conference Final against the Dallas Stars with a spectacular individual effort on the power play.\n\nWith another man advantage later in the first, he added a primary assist on what proved to be the game winner by Zach Hyman. The Oilers advanced to the Stanley Cup Final for the first time since 2006 with a 2-1 win, taking the series against the Stars by a 4-2 margin.\n\nEdmonton will now face the Florida Panthers, who dispatched the New York Rangers in six games on Saturday to reach the final for a second-straight year. The Stanley Cup Final will begin next Saturday at Amerant Bank Arena in Sunrise, Fla.\n\nAs the lower-seeded squads in the conference finals, both Edmonton and Florida were able to celebrate their series wins in front of their home fans. With 110 points, the Panthers won the Atlantic Division and finished fifth overall in the league standings. The Oilers were six points back with 104 points. They finished second in the Pacific Division, behind the Vancouver Canucks.\n\nBut a month into the 2023-24 season, no one would have projected the Oilers to go on their best playoff run of the McDavid era. They started the season with a record of 3-9-1 before coach Jay Woodcroft was replaced by Kris Knoblauch on Nov. 12, 2023.\n\nHired out of the AHL, with no NHL experience except two years as an assistant coach with the Philadelphia Flyers, 45-year-old Knoblauch coached the Oilers to a league-best .703 points percentage through the remaining 69 games of the regular season.\n\nIn the playoffs, Edmonton dispatched the Los Angeles Kings in five games before rebounding from a 3-2 series deficit to eliminate the Canucks. The Oilers also fell into a 2-1 series hole against the Stars before flipping a switch after giving up two early goals in Game 4. From there, they outscored Dallas 10-2 to advance.\n\nHeading into the final, the Oilers occupy four of the top five spots in the playoff scoring race. The top-scoring Panther, Matthew Tkachuk, sits sixth.\n\nConnor McDavid (EDM) - 29 pts Leon Draisaitl (EDM) - 27 pts Evan Bouchard (EDM) - 25 pts Vincent Trocheck (NYR) - 20 pts Ryan Nugent-Hopkins (EDM) - 20 pts Matthew Tkachuk (FLA) - 19 pts\n\nFor years, the Oilers have been known for their offense. McDavid has five Art Ross trophies as the NHL’s regular-season scoring leader, and Draisaitl also has one.\n\nWhat’s different this year is the defending. At 24, Bouchard has broken out as a point producer, and the Oilers’ penalty kill has been rock solid — 14-for-14 against Dallas and 43-for-46 through three rounds of the playoffs.\n\nEdmonton’s power play has been a crucial weapon — 17 for 49 in the playoffs and producing four of Edmonton’s last five goals to clinch the series against Dallas. But Florida just limited a formidable Rangers unit to one goal in six games, and the Panthers’ 14 power-play goals on 60 opportunities are second-most in the playoffs, behind only Edmonton.\n\nWill one side find a special-teams advantage, or will the two strong penalty kills cancel each other out and force the final to be decided at 5-on-5?\n\nThe Florida Panthers have been a confident squad that looks like they still have more to give as ... [+] they enter the 2024 Stanley Cup Final. (Photo by Eliot J. Schechter/NHLI via Getty Images) NHLI via Getty Images\n\nBy the time the Panthers got to the 2023 Stanley Cup Final last season, they were battered and broken, and a comparatively healthy Vegas Golden Knights squad took them down in five games.\n\nThis year, Florida has been better equipped to deal with what has come its way, both physically and emotionally. With roster additions like Vladimir Tarasenko, Kyle Okposo, Evan Rodrigues and Oliver Ekman-Larsson, the Panthers are deeper and not as worn at this stage. Last year, they needed to stage a two-month late-season push to snag the final spot in the Eastern Conference playoff race during the last week of the regular season, and start their postseason journey.\n\nOn the surface, the Panthers also hold an advantage in net, with two-time Vezina Trophy winner Sergei Bobrovsky going against second-year NHLer Stuart Skinner. But Skinner has been solid since returning to the net after being pulled for two games against the Canucks, and gave up just two goals a game against the high-octane Stars.\n\nEdmonton has already stared down potential elimination twice against Vancouver. And while the Panthers famously erased a 3-1 deficit in the first round against the Boston Bruins last season, they’ve had an easier run this year — taking down the Tampa Bay Lightning in five games, then beating both the Bruins and the Rangers in six.\n\nBoth sides are riding three-game winning streaks coming into the final. That should generate plenty of confidence among both fanbases. Next Saturday, something will have to give, which should make for a terrific series opener.\n\nThe Oilers, famously, have won five Stanley Cups in their history. But all five came between 1984 and 1990. The Panthers didn’t even join the NHL as an expansion franchise until 1993. They’ve never won the Cup and before last year, their only other appearance in the final came in 1996.\n\nIt’s a sun-belt expansion squad vs. a storied franchise that’s looking to bring a championship to Canada for the first time since the Montreal Canadiens won the Stanley Cup in 1993.\n\nIn a couple of weeks, we’ll know how it all turns out.",

            "summary": "SUNRISE, Fla. — It has become an annual rite of passage, sort of like Daylight Savings Time. But instead of moving the clock ahead by an hour every spring, the Rangers add another year to their Stanley Cup drought.\n\nIt will be 31 years since the last ride up the Canyon of Heroes for the Rangers, who were a very good team this year and a very good team through the first two rounds of the playoffs but could not quite sustain it against a bigger, stronger, more physical team in the conference final.\n\nThere’s no shame to it. This wasn’t last year’s no-show defeat to the Devils. The Rangers left everything they had on the ice in this six-game series in which they were brutalized, pounded and softened up through the opening three contests by a Panthers team that fattened up by winning the final three games of this conference final.\n\n4 Rangers players shake hands with the Panthers after their season-ending 2-1 loss in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Final. Charles Wenzelberg / New York Post\n\nIndeed, the Rangers left everything they had on the ice for the duration of the season in which they finished with the best record in the league and advanced to the conference final for the second time in three years.\n\nThey just weren’t quite good enough, kind of the same way they were not good enough in their six-game ouster by Tampa Bay two years ago, even if that unexpected run had a different feel to it.\n\nIt was 2-1 for the Panthers in Saturday’s Game 6 to send Florida to the Cup final for the second consecutive year following their five-game defeat to Vegas last June. The Rangers were not forced to spend as much time in their zone as they had the previous three contests — the ice began to tilt dramatically in the Blueshirts’ Game 3 overtime victory — but they could not generate meaningful scoring chances against Sergei Bobrovsky.\n\nIndeed, the Blueshirts scored five goals over the final three games — one on the power play, one shorthanded, one five-on-five, and two at six-on-five with the extra attacker that included Artemi Panarin’s last-gasp goal at 18:20 of the third period to bring his team within one.\n\n4 Igor Shesterkin skates away from the net after giving up a goal to Vladimir Tarasenko\n\nduring the third period of the Rangers’ season-ending loss. Charles Wenzelberg / New York Post\n\n“I would say that we’re a good team that gave everything,” said Panarin, who ripped one over Bobrovsky’s shoulder late for his first goal of the series and fifth of the tournament. “These games were so tight.”\n\nPanarin made reference to the fact that maybe the Rangers should have played like they did in the final five minutes when they attempted to swarm the zone. But Florida broke up play after play through the neutral zone on those rare occasions the Rangers were able to break out of their own end with coherence.\n\nThe Rangers bought in all year. They were the best-coached team on Broadway in decades. They asked to be coached after last spring’s debacle and they responded to incoming head coach Peter Laviolette and his staff from beginning to end. They were one of the four best teams in the NHL in a 32-team league.\n\nFollow The Post’s coverage of the Rangers in the NHL playoffs\n\nIt’s not everything but it’s not nothing, either.\n\n“Our guys fought this year, they bought in right from the start,” Laviolette said. “They fought, we make it to this point and it’s disappointing when you start something like this, you don’t do it to get three wins in the playoffs or five wins in the playoffs, you do it to go the whole way so there’s disappointment that sets in, for sure.\n\n“With regard to our intentions we had throughout the course of the year, the whole thing was to avoid what we’re feeling right now. No one expected to be on this end of it.”\n\n4 Artemi Panarin, who scored only one goal in the series, shakes hands with Sergei Bobrovsky after the Rangers’ season-ending loss. Charles Wenzelberg / New York Post\n\nThe Rangers are built to certain specifications. The Rangers are built on their power play. The Panthers put it on a spike, killing 14 of 15 New York advantages. The inviolate first unit was overwhelmed most of the time. It wasn’t only this series, too, the Blueshirts going 2-for-25 over the final 10 games of the tournament. Laviolette wouldn’t mix up the personnel.\n\nChris Kreider had difficulty forming words after his elimination-game record dropped to a career 20-10. The “10” represents the 10 playoff seasons for which No. 20 has been a Ranger. He recovered to give an analysis of the series, but there is 2012 disappointment as a 21-year-old, there is 2017 disappointment as a 26-year-old, and there is now disappointment as a 33-year-old.\n\nKreider had little impact on the series, getting only that shorthanded goal in Game 5. Mika Zibanejad had little impact on the series, failing to record a goal. Panarin got the one goal. Adam Fox did not score in the playoffs. K’Andre Miller had a difficult series. So did Jacob Trouba.\n\n4 Peter Laviolette and the Rangers players react on the bench during the third period of their season-ending loss. Charles Wenzelberg / New York Post\n\nMiller and Trouba, by the way, were the only Rangers defensemen to score a goal in the postseason and both were shorthanded. That is hard to believe.\n\nThe Rangers could not get to the inside just like the Rangers could not get to the inside against the Lightning in 2022. Maybe someone can sense a pattern. Maybe someone will acknowledge that size still matters as much as it ever did when it comes to the playoffs.\n\nWhen push came to shove, the Rangers were shoved out of the playoffs and that should never be allowed to happen again.\n\nRead the expert take on the Blueshirts Sign up for Larry Brooks' Inside the Rangers, a weekly Sports+ exclusive.

Pan had quite the interesting final round at the RBC Canadian Open on Sunday.\n\nHis caddie, Mike \"Fluff\" Cowan, suffered an injury early in the round when he slipped, and while it was non-serious, he could not remain on Pan’s bag for the rest of the day.\n\nCowan, 76, is a legend among PGA Tour caddies, having worked with Jim Furyk for over two decades. However, his slip on the third fairway at Hamilton Golf and Country Club Sunday led to someone else needing to fulfill his caddie duties. He has also been Tiger Woods’ caddie, as well as Peter Jacobsen's over the years.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nKevin Prise of PGATour.com reported that a local fan, Paul Emerson, stepped in to take over when he saw Cowan go down. A self-proclaimed \"golf nerd,\" Emerson wanted to help Pan, and the golfer accepted at the moment.\n\n\"I helped Fluff get the bib off, threw it on and started walking up the hole,\" Emerson said.\n\nUS WOMEN'S OPEN GOLFER STRIKES BIRD DURING TEE SHOT IN BIZARRE 1ST-ROUND SCENE\n\nPer PGA Tour rules, it was completely allowed for Emerson to step in and help Pan. However, his services did not last long.\n\nOnce the tournament caught wind of the situation, a member of the caddie services team stepped up to replace Emerson on the fifth hole.\n\nHowever, Pan was not done making changes to his bag. He recruited Al Riddell, who caddies Paul Bargon on Tour regularly and lived near the course, to hop on his bag on the back nine.\n\nRiddell was Pan’s fourth caddie for the day, and he would finish the day with him.\n\nPan would finish with a 1-under 69 in his final round, which included an eagle on Hole 12 that brought him up to two-under on the round. Pan finished 3-under for the tournament, which was 13 shots worse than the eventual winner, Robert MacIntyre, who won his first-ever PGA Tour event.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNot quite the finish Pan wanted to have in the tournament, especially with Cowan going down, but many stepped up to make sure he had a helping hand along the way.\n\nFollow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.",

            "summary": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nC.T. Pan received assistance from four different caddies -- including a fan -- during Sunday's final round at the PGA Tour's RBC Canadian Open.\n\nMike \"Fluff\" Cowan, Pan's caddie, slipped and fell on the third hole in the rainy conditions at Hamilton Golf and Country Club. Cowan, 76, suffered \"nonserious\" injuries, according to a PGA Tour official, and was shown watching the action from a golf cart.\n\nA random fan, Paul Emerson from nearby Aurora, Ontario, emerged from the crowd to briefly hold the bag for Pan. Emerson said he asked Pan if he could help as the golfer was walking Cowan to the medic adjacent to the fairway.\n\n\"I helped Fluff get the bib off, threw it on and started walking up the hole,\" Emerson said, according to PGATour.com.\n\nNot all heroes wear capes, but some wear bibs.\n\n\n\nRT to thank Paul Emerson for stepping up in caddie relief! @ctpangolf | @PGATOUR | #RBCCO pic.twitter.com/losw6kPmNG — RBC Canadian Open (@RBCCanadianOpen) June 2, 2024\n\nEmerson, who said he once caddied for a friend during a pro-am for an LPGA Tour event, ultimately was replaced by Mike Campbell, who works in caddie services at the club, on the fifth hole.\n\nAlex Riddell, who serves as the caddie for Paul Barjon, replaced Campbell for the back nine. Riddell lives in Hamilton, Ontario, and was familiar with Pan from PGA Tour Canada. Sportsnet said Riddell was watching on television and went to the course to offer his services.\n\nPan ended up shooting a 1-under 69. The highlight of his final round was a 121-yard approach that he holed for an eagle 2 on the par-4 12th.\n\nCowan took over on Pan's bag last month following his amicable split after 25 years with Jim Furyk (1999-2024). He previously caddied for Tiger Woods (1996-99).\n\nInformation from Field Level Media was used in this report.",
