            "title": "‘La Presidenta’: Claudia Sheinbaum wins historic Mexico election mandate",
            "summary": "The country’s first female president faces a raft of challenges, from crime to a fractured polity.\n\nMexico has elected Claudia Sheinbaum, a former mayor of the capital, as the country’s first female president after a heated election on Sunday, with the nation’s top election authority projecting a comfortable win for the 61-year-old physicist-turned-politician.\n\nSheinbaum, a protege of Mexico’s outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, is expected to win more than 58 percent of the national vote, the National Electoral Institute of Mexico (INE) said, in what is known as a “quick count” of the vote.\n\nHer win entrenches the governing Morena party’s hold over power in Mexico, six years after Lopez Obrador, also known by his initials AMLO, ran an anti-establishment campaign against the country’s traditionally mainstream parties to win the 2018 election.\n\n“I commit to you that I will not let you down,” Sheinbaum said, in a victory statement on X. “There is history, there is homeland, there is people, and there is commitment.”\n\nLate on Sunday night in Mexico, the principal opposition candidate, Xochitl Galvez, conceded defeat. A trained engineer with Indigenous roots, Galvez rose from poverty to become a tech entrepreneur.\n\n“A few minutes ago, I contacted … Sheinbaum to acknowledge the election result. I told her that I saw a Mexico with a lot of pain and violence and that I hope she can resolve the serious problems of our people,” she was quoted as saying by local media.\n\nDuring her campaign, Sheinbaum faced questions over her close ties to AMLO — a president who enjoys vast popularity in Mexico, despite critics accusing him of authoritarian tendencies — including whether she would be able to lead independently.\n\nHowever, Sheinbaum and Lopez Obrador have insisted that he would hold no influence over her government.\n\n“I am going to retire completely,” he said last year. “I will never again appear at any public event.”\n\n“I do not want to be anybody’s adviser … I will not have any relationship with politicians,” the president said, adding, “I am not going to talk about politics.”\n\nA mystery\n\nSheinbaum struggled to establish her identity in this campaign while under AMLO’s influence.\n\nWhile trying to convince Mexicans to vote for her, she has adhered closely to his policies, while also trying to assert her individuality. To many, Mexico’s first female president remains somewhat a mystery.\n\n“It’s complicated,” Juan Pablo Micozzi, an associate professor of political science at Mexico’s Autonomous Institute of Technology (ITAM), told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Her [political] trajectory has been practically an unconditional alignment with AMLO … So, it’s really hard for me to understand what Claudia is going to do on day one without AMLO in charge,” Micozzi added.\n\nHowever, there may be some clues in her early life, suggest other analysts.\n\nSheinbaum grew up in a family deeply engaged in activism, and her involvement began from a young age. At 15, she volunteered to assist groups of mothers searching for their missing children, while in the 1980s she also joined protests against state intervention in education policies.\n\nShe earned her PhD in energy engineering at the age of 33, and as she prepared her thesis, she spent time at the University of California, Berkeley in the United States.\n\nHer political journey started in 2000 when Lopez Obrador, then the newly elected mayor of Mexico City, selected her to serve as the leader of his environmental team.\n\nIn the years that followed, she actively campaigned for AMLO and developed her own academic and political career, including serving as the mayor of Tlalpan and then Mexico City.\n\n“I believe we can anticipate a presidency under Sheinbaum that is more disciplined than Lopez Obrador’s,” Carlos Ramirez, a political analyst at Integralia, a Mexico City-based consultancy, told Al Jazeera. “A more orderly presidency, a presidency with more planning, with a more technical profile among the officials who will surely accompany and surround her in her cabinet.”\n\nRamirez said he expects Sheinbaum to be a “president who better understands the world, unlike Lopez Obrador, whose vision has always been very provincial, very local”.\n\nNevertheless, she assumes leadership of a nation confronting a range of challenges — with security issues at the forefront.\n\n‘It’s a matter of state capacity’\n\nIn recent years, Mexico has seen more than 30,000 murders a year, and some 100,000 people are still unaccounted for.\n\nThe lead-up to the June 2 election was exceptionally violent, with 37 candidates killed and hundreds forced to withdraw from the race.\n\nAccording to the annual public survey conducted by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), six out of 10 Mexican citizens rate insecurity as their primary concern.\n\nHowever, during Sheinbaum’s time as Mexico’s City mayor, according to a Reuters report, the homicide rate fell 50 percent between December 2018 and June 2023. She credited this to successful security measures which enhanced police operations and collaboration with prosecutors.\n\nAt the federal level, Sheinbaum has expressed her intention to continue AMLO’s strategy of avoiding confrontation with crime groups, while also relying on the National Guard, which is operated by the military, for security operations.\n\n“They will have to continue using the army because … [no other] institution has the strength to face the potential problems associated with the cartels and organised crime groups,” Miguel Angel Toro Rios, dean of the School of Social Sciences and Government at Tecnologico de Monterrey, a Monterrey-based university, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It’s a matter of state capacity, and Mexico does not have the state capacity without the army to face these kinds of problems,” he added.",

            "summary": "COTIJA, Mexico (AP) — Mexico’s drug cartels and gangs appear to be playing a wider role than before in Sunday’s elections that will determine the presidency, nine governorships and about 19,000 mayorships and other local posts.\n\nThe country’s powerful drug cartels have long staged targeted assassinations of mayoral and other local candidates who threaten their control. Gangs in Mexico depend on controlling local police chiefs, and taking a share of municipal budgets; national politics appear to interest them less.\n\nBut in the runup to Sunday’s vote, gangs have increasingly taken to spraying whole campaign rallies with gunfire, burning ballots or preventing the setting up of polling stations, and even putting up banners seeking to influence voters.\n\nMexico elections Mexicans are voting Sunday in historic elections weighing gender, democracy and populism, as they chart the country’s path forward in voting shadowed by cartel violence. Follow live updates here.\n\nSecurity analyst David Saucedo says it’s likely some drug gangs will try to force voters to cast ballots for their favored candidates.\n\n“It it is reasonable to assume that the cartels will mobilize their support bases during Sunday’s elections,” Saucedo said. “They have loyal voters who they have won over through the distribution of food packages, cash, medicine and infrastructure projects. They will use them to support narco-candidates.”\n\nIn some places, it appears the gangs are encouraging people to vote while discouraging voting in areas controlled by their rivals.\n\nOn Friday, electoral authorities reported that assailants burned a house where ballots were being stored ahead of Sunday in the violence-wracked town of Chicomuselo, in the southern state of Chiapas. While they did not say who was behind the attack, the town is completely dominated by two warring drug cartels, Jalisco and Sinaloa.\n\nOn May 14, gunmen apparently linked to a cartel shot and killed 11 people in a single day in Chicomuselo. On May 17, five people were killed along with a mayoral candidate when gunmen opened fire on a crowd in the town of La Concordia, Chiapas, about 45 miles (75 kilometers) east of Chicomuselo.\n\nTargeted assassinations of local candidates continued. On Wednesday, dramatic video images showed a mayoral candidate in the southern state of Guerrero being shot in the head at point-blank rage with a pistol. A total of 31 candidates, almost all running for mayorships, have been killed this year.\n\nBut mass attacks on campaign rallies, once exceedingly rare in Mexico, are becoming common, and have killed many more supporters than candidates this year. The effect is intimidating.\n\nOn Wednesday, the last official day of campaigning, unidentified gunmen opened fire a couple of blocks away from a mayoral candidate’s final campaign rally in the western state of Michoacan, sending hundreds of people scrambling for safety.\n\n“It seemed like a normal evening, like the campaign closers of other candidates,” said Angélica Chávez, a homemaker who was at the rally in Cotija. “Then there were gunshots, several rounds of gunfire very close. And then people started running and diving to the ground, crouching.”\n\nChávez was hurt in the stampede and had to take refuge in a local church.\n\nIn Celaya, a city in Guanajuato, gunmen opened fire on a campaign event in April, killing a mayoral candidate and wounding three of her supporters.\n\nSaucedo, the analyst, sees the shootings as a sign that narco gangs are no longer willing to see their handpicked candidates lose.\n\n“Rather than allow the victory of a candidate who is not in line with their criminal interests, or allow a candidate linked to a rival drug gang to win, they use this tactic,” Saucedo said. “What we’re seeing in the final stretch is pretty desperate strategy on the part of some groups of drug traffickers.”\n\nSaucedo said that such attempts at narco-control of local politics had been seen previously in some particularly violent states, like Tamaulipas. “What was once limited ... is now spreading to include the whole country,” he said.\n\nThe National Electoral Institute says it has had to cancel plans for 170 polling places, mostly in Chiapas and Michoacan and mostly because of security problems. In Chiapas, electoral authorities say there are places they can’t even go to. While that’s a tiny fraction of the country’s 170,858 polling places, it’s disturbing.\n\nAnd in the northern border city of Nuevo Laredo, a shadowy group that local media reports link to the dominant Northeast drug cartel has put up posters claiming one mayoral candidate is linked to the rival Gulf drug cartel.\n\nAuthorities have not confirmed the origin of the crude poster, which includes a photoshopped image of the candidate waving an assault rifle and wearing a bulletproof vest with the Gulf cartel’s insignia.\n\nIn the state of Morelos, just south of Mexico City, residents awoke this week to find a banner strung over a road claiming a gubernatorial candidate was tied to rival drug gangs. The banner was signed by a local drug boss whose name is unknown, “the Commander of the Three Letters.”\n\nAnother apparently gang-related banner threatened that anyone trying to buy votes would be “punished severely.” That banner was signed by “Those who have always called the shots here.”\n\nSuch events appear to indicate that past calculations by the cartels — take out the strongest candidate you don’t like, and the remaining major-party candidate will win by default — have become more complicated.\n\nIn one town in Michoacan, Maravatio, the gangs apparently tried to eliminate any doubts as to who will win this year; they killed off three candidates for town mayor who were apparently not to their liking.\n\n___\n\nSánchez reported from Mexico City.

            "title": "Jury selection is beginning in gun case against President Joe Biden’s son",
            "summary": "WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Jury selection is to begin Monday in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden’s son after a deal with prosecutors fell apart that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election.\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his father, has been charged with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he’s being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment.\n\nThe trial comes just four days after Donald Trump was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City after a jury found him guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are not related, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a years-long investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned some unusual aspects of the deal that included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a “diversion agreement” on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn’t about Hunter Biden’s foreign business affairs — which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden’s darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president’s allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who’s long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He’s also protective; Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad, and attending church together.\n\nBiden, in a last minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding the helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show he was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun - and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they’re planning to use as evidence Hunter Biden’s published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos where he’s often nude and doing drugs and highly personal messages where he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe’s also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she’ll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: “Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?”\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period where, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother Beau Biden from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018, and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn’t see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked “no” to the question on the form. They’ll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden’s ex-wife and his brother’s widow Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it is unclear whether the judge would actually give him time behind bars if he were convicted.",

            "summary": "Hunter Biden’s criminal trial will begin with jury selection Monday morning in Delaware. The trial stems from federal gun charges brought against him by special counsel David Weiss.\n\nHunter Biden pleaded not guilty to federal gun charges in U.S. District Court for Delaware after Weiss charged him with making a false statement in the purchase of a firearm; making a false statement related to information required to be kept by a licensed firearm dealer; and one count of possession of a firearm by a person who is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance.\n\nWith all counts combined, the total maximum prison time for the charges could be up to 25 years. Each count carries a maximum fine of $250,000 and three years of supervised release.\n\nThe trial begins nearly a year after presiding Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned a plea deal between prosecutors and Hunter Biden, which subsequently fell apart.\n\nJUDGE BARS PROSECUTORS FROM USING SOME SALACIOUS EVIDENCE IN HUNTER BIDEN'S GUN TRIAL\n\nThe agreement, blasted as a \"sweetheart\" deal by congressional Republicans, appeared to convey broad immunity to the president's son on a host of potential criminal charges.\n\nAccording to an indictment, Hunter Biden bought a Colt Cobra revolver Oct. 12, 2018, and \"knowingly made a false and fictitious written statement, intended and likely to deceive that dealer with respect to a fact material to the lawfulness of the sale of the firearm … certifying he was not an unlawful user of, and addicted to, any stimulant, narcotic drug, and any other controlled substance, when in fact, as he knew, that statement was false and fictitious.\"\n\nThe indictment also charges Hunter Biden with possessing that gun, which was \"shipped and transported in interstate commerce,\" for nearly a week despite being addicted to narcotics.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN IS IN COURT IN DELAWARE. HERE'S WHAT HE DOESN'T WANT THE JURY TO HEAR\n\nFox News first reported in 2021 that police had responded to an incident in 2018, when a gun owned by Hunter was thrown into a trash can outside a market in Delaware.\n\nA source with knowledge of the Oct. 23, 2018, police report told Fox News it indicated that Hallie Biden, who is the widow of President Biden's late son, Beau, and who was in a relationship with Hunter at the time, threw a gun owned by Hunter in a dumpster behind a market near a school.\n\nHallie Biden may be required to testify during Hunter Biden's trial.\n\nA firearm transaction report reviewed by Fox News indicated Hunter purchased a gun earlier that month.\n\nOn the firearm transaction report, Hunter answered in the negative when asked if he was \"an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance.\"\n\nHunter was discharged from the Navy in 2014 after testing positive for cocaine.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO FEDERAL GUN CHARGES OUT OF SPECIAL COUNSEL DAVID WEISS' PROBE\n\nJudge Noreika ruled ahead of the trial that Weiss’s team cannot use some salacious evidence in the first son’s criminal trial, including references to the Navy discharge and his child support case for his out-of-wedlock daughter in Arkansas.\n\nNoreika also said Weiss must show Hunter Biden was addicted to drugs but not necessarily using drugs the day he purchased the gun.\n\nNoreika said the government may use part of Hunter Biden's book in which he discusses his addiction to drugs.\n\nThe prosecution does not plan to bring out the entire infamous laptop containing details of Hunter Biden's life but will introduce certain portions. Noreika ruled that Hunter Biden’s team will be able to question aspects of the laptop in front of the jury. The laptop, which leaked in 2020 just before the presidential election, was decried as Russian disinformation by 51 former intelligence officials.\n\nNoreika also ruled that the special counsel cannot mention Hunter Biden's pending federal tax trial in California during the trial in Delaware, which is also part of Weiss's investigation and scheduled for a September trial.\n\nHunter Biden pleaded not guilty to those charges — specifically, three felonies and six misdemeanors concerning $1.4 million in owed taxes that have since been paid. Weiss alleged a \"four-year scheme\" when the president’s son did not pay his federal income taxes from January 2017 to October 2020 while also filing false tax reports.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN TAX TRIAL POSTPONED TO SEPTEMBER\n\nJudge Mark Scarsi heard arguments during a pre-trial hearing in California last month. That criminal trial was scheduled for June 20, but Hunter Biden’s attorneys requested to delay the trial.\n\nScarsi sided with Hunter Biden’s attorneys, and moved the tax trial to Sept. 5, when jury selection will begin.",

He has pleaded not guilty. It is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California.\n\nThe trial in Wilmington, with U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika presiding, begins with the jury selection process.\n\nTrump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York on Thursday of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 U.S. election that put him in the White House. Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases.\n\nHunter Biden was charged last September in the case brought by U.S. Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, with lying about his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and with illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018. Weiss, who has investigated Hunter Biden since at least 2019, also brought the tax charges.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nHunter Biden spent the weekend with his father in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the pair biking and attending church together on Saturday in the sunny beach town. The president, who had been expected to depart Rehoboth Beach on Monday, traveled on Sunday evening to his home in Wilmington.\n\nPotential jurors will be screened for their ability to commit to serving the length of the trial, which is expected to run through the end of next week. All 12 jurors must agree he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nThe case is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box for \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nProsecution lawyers revealed in court filings that they may use details gleaned from Hunter Biden's phone and iCloud account, including photos of him smoking crack and messages with drug dealers. They said they may call as a witness his former wife Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers have indicated they may try to show he had completed a drug rehabilitation program before purchasing the gun and may have considered his answer on the gun purchase form to be truthful.\n\nA plea agreement that would have resolved the gun and tax charges without prison time collapsed last year after Noreika questioned the extent of the immunity it extended to Biden. Hunter Biden's lawyers blamed Republican pressure for the failure of the plea agreement.\n\nCongressional Republicans spent years in vain trying to find evidence of a corrupt link between Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, including work for Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and his father's political power.\n\n(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; additional reporting by Stephanie Kelly in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware; editing by Amy Stevens, Will Dunham and Michael Perry)",

            "summary": "Wilmington, Delaware CNN —\n\nThe federal judge overseeing Hunter Biden’s gun trial dealt his defense two setbacks Sunday, on the eve of jury selection, by blocking one of his expert witnesses and excluding a key piece of evidence the president’s son hoped to use.\n\nThe rulings from Judge Maryellen Noreika resolved some of the sticking points that were still simmering before the trial begins Monday. Taken together, these decisions could make a tough case for Hunter Biden even more challenging to win. President Joe Biden’s son has pleaded not guilty to illegally buying and owning a gun while abusing illicit drugs.\n\nNoreika granted a request from special counsel David Weiss to block one of Hunter Biden’s expert witnesses from testifying. The defense had lined up a Columbia University-based psychiatrist who would’ve tried to poke holes in prosecutors’ assertions that Hunter Biden knew he was an addict in 2018 when he bought the gun that led to his indictment.\n\n“The inadequacy of Defendant’s expert disclosure for Dr. (Elie) Aoun leaves the government in the dark as to what his opinions about the facts of this case will be, thus rendering the government unable to prepare for trial,” Noreika wrote in her ruling.\n\nThe judge also blocked Hunter Biden’s lawyers from using what they thought was a key piece of exculpatory evidence: an altered version of the federal firearms form he filled out when he bought the gun in 2018 that was tweaked in 2021 by the gun store employees.\n\nHunter Biden’s lawyers recently argued in court that they wanted to use the doctored form to undermine the credibility of the employees, who are slated to testify on behalf of the prosecutors. They also claimed it showed prosecutors were politically “biased.”\n\nBut Noreika ruled the altered version of the form was “irrelevant and inadmissible,” and she went on to blast Hunter Biden’s team for pushing “conspiratorial” theories and “unsupported rhetoric” about the motivations of the Wilmington gun store employees.\n\n“Any probative value it arguably has is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, and misleading the jury,” she wrote, further adding that any attempts by the defense to use the altered form to demonstrate the employees’ alleged political bias would have been “unduly prejudicial and invites (jury) nullification.”\n\nOnly the original form – known as ATF Form 4473 – will be shown to the jury.\n\nOn that form, Hunter Biden is accused of falsely swearing that he wasn’t using or addicted to drugs, which allowed him to purchase the gun. Prosecutors contend he was still addicted to crack cocaine at that time, as he has described in his memoir.\n\nJury selection for the trial is slated to begin Monday morning in Wilmington.",

The wildfire exploded to more than 12,000 acres burned several structures and shut down an interstate freeway southwest of Tracy. Evacuation orders remain in place. The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa\n\nAmid strong but seasonal winds, Firefighters on Sunday gained the upper hand after a wildfire exploded to 14,000 acres Saturday, burning at least one home and shutting down two freeways, before officials relaxed mandatory evacuations in an area southwest of Tracy.\n\nThe Corral Fire started around 3 p.m. Saturday along Corral Hollow Road on the border of Alameda and San Joaquin counties, on land used by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s Site 300, a facility that once developed explosives material and other ordnance. It was not clear what started the blaze, said Cal Fire’s Santa Clara unit, which is in unified command with Alameda County Fire Department teams.\n\nIn a 6 p.m. update, officials said the fire had scorched 14,168 acres and was 50% contained as crews worked through another day of southwesterly winds that push flames against a small residential area known as Par Country Estates along Interstate 580. The fire was burning 25 miles west of Modesto and 60 miles south of Sacramento.\n\n“Strong winds and dry grass have made it difficult to contain,” Cal Fire SCU said in its Sunday morning update. But, by afternoon, officials had made progress on the threat to homes in the area and emergency officials had downgraded mandatory evacuations to warnings. San Joaquin County officials said those warnings would go into effect at 6 p.m.\n\nTwo firefighters from the Alameda department were being treated for minor injuries Saturday, Cal Fire said.\n\nCal Fire SCU personnel work to cut off flames in the median of Interstate 580 south of Tracy during the Corral Fire on Saturday. The wildfire exploded to more than 12,000 acres burned several structures and shut down an interstate freeway southwest of Tracy. Evacuation orders remain in place. Kent Porter The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa\n\nRoadways reopen as conditions improve\n\nAround noon Sunday, both directions of Interstate 580 were reopened, reconnecting Interstate 5 — a major arterial between Southern California and Bay Area — with Altamont Pass. Caltrans District 10 officials said one eastbound lane would remain closed between I-205 and I-5 to buffer firefighting efforts. Highway 132 was also reopened after being shut down for about 17 hours.\n\nBetween the fire’s start and midnight, the wind-whipped blaze leaped to 10,000 acres and burned one home and several outbuildings and vehicles. The fire was able to cross the four-lane freeway on Saturday in several spots, Cal Fire perimeter maps showed. Crews responded by keeping the flames limited in an area close to the San Joaquin-Stanislaus county line. Other spot fires had nowhere to go once they reached the California Aqueduct.\n\nEight miles north, away from the winds and smoke that hung over the fire, an American flag wrapped around the flagpole outside Larch Clover Community Center in north Tracy.\n\nFive volunteers sat inside the community center next to tables filled with water bottles, Blue Diamond almonds and “flaming hot” beef jerky. Despite the provisions, only four people had come in for services on Sunday as of 11:30 a.m., a volunteer said.\n\nApproximately 25 evacuees had come in Saturday, mainly to get information, before moving on to area hotels.\n\nIn a morning update, firefighters said “weather conditions became more favorable for firefighters, allowing crews to make progress constructing and improving control lines.”\n\nA home on Vernalis Road in the Diablo Range foothills is seen intact Sunday after flames from the Corral Fire surrounded the property south of Tracy. Containment on the 14,000-acre wildfire rose mid-day Sunday to 30% as crews battled winds in strong vegetation along the I-580 corridor. Cal Fire SCU\n\nWinds were expected to remain gusty\n\nWinds in the area were fierce overnight — but not unusual for an area that’s dotted with wind turbines just to the north. At Altamont Pass, southwest winds hovered around 40 mph with gusts to 50 mph recorded about 3 a.m. Winds at the San Joaquin-Stanislaus county line were gusting to 25 mph, according to sensor readings collected by the National Weather Service.\n\nIdamis Shoemaker, a meteorologist at the weather service’s Sacramento office, said winds during the day were expected to remain between 20 and 30 mph but strong winds were expected to pick back up into the evening in the fire area.\n\nShoemaker said gusts in the general area of the fire could reach 35 mph, which is normal for this time of year as onshore breezes push over the coastal mountains and down into the Central Valley.\n\nA firefighting bulldozer cuts a fire line Saturday, June 1, 2024, to stop progress of the Corral Fire, a 12,500-acre grass fire burning in San Joaquin County. Strong winds had pushed the blaze up to homes and a freeway south of Tracy. Cal Fire SCU\n\nAs aerial crews flew in at daybreak to help the more than 400 personnel on the ground fight the blaze, ranch homes along Vernalis Road, just south of Highway 132 and near the Tracy Golf and Country Club, had been spared because of defensible space around their dwellings.\n\nOne home in the area had burned overnight, along with several outbuildings and an abandoned home and barn.\n\nThe San Joaquin County Office Of Emergency Services said it would relax the mandatory evacuations for areas west of the California Aqueduct, south of Corral Hollow Creek, west to the Alameda County line and south to the Stanislaus County line, around 6 p.m., allowing residents to return.\n\nA homeowner on Vernalis Road evacuates his horse Saturday as smoke from the Corral Fire bear down on ranches south of Tracy.

Kent Porter The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa\n\n‘We haven’t had one this close in a long time’\n\nChristine and Jamilyn Lewis drove out to Chrisman Road’s intersection with Durham Ferry Road, where the California Highway Patrol had closed traffic to the blackened hills beyond Sunday afternoon. The mother and daughter live about 5 miles from West Corral Hollow Road, where the fire started.\n\nJamilyn Lewis was out with friends Saturday when she saw smoke in the air and said, “Well, that’s not good.” Meanwhile, her mother began frantically packing a few days’ worth of clothes and dog food for their 4-month-old German Shepherd puppy, Harley, in case they needed to evacuate to a Tracy Wildlife Association campground.\n\n“My husband always has a bug-out bag, and he was all ‘I told you!’” Christine Lewis said. “We kind of threw our stuff together last night, and I was up until like 6 a.m.”\n\nThe fire reminded Lewis and her husband of living in the Bay Area during the 1991 Oakland Hills firestorm, which killed 25 people and destroyed more than 3,000 homes. She moved to Tracy months later, and hadn’t run into a similar blaze until Saturday.\n\n“We haven’t had one this close in a long time, and we’ve been out here 28 years,” she said.\n\nThe Lewis’ home was still safe as of Sunday afternoon, but Christine spoke to a friend at about 10 p.m. Saturday whose 500-acre ranch had burned up, decimating multiple structures. After that, she and her husband began preparing to load their Harley-Davidson motorcycles into a trailer in case of evacuation. Harley, the puppy, would ride with Jamilyn in the car.\n\nInvestigation of the blaze begins\n\nSeveral homes nearby remained without power after fire knocked down lines Saturday, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said. PG&E also said firefighters had asked for some lines to be de-energized. As many as 3,800 ratepayers were in the dark Saturday night, only about 160 remained interrupted, the utility said.\n\nAn evacuation shelter remained open at the Larch Clover Community Center, 11157 W. Larch Road. County officials also hosted an animal evacuation center at the Manteca Education & Training Center, 2271 W. Louise Ave.\n\nIn addition to the 60 engines, 12 water tenders and nine hand crews fighting flames, a team of investigators was on scene near Site 300 to begin investigating what sparked the fire, Cal Fire said.\n\nFire officials said previous prescribed burns in the area initially helped to slow the spread but no prescribed fire plans were started or burning on Saturday, said Cheryl Hurd, a spokesperson for Alameda County Fire.\n\nThis story was originally published June 1, 2024, 7:17 PM.",

Of course they do,\" he said. \"But they don't have the military capabilities to do what they did.\"\n\nIn another development on Sunday, the government of the Maldives announced it would ban Israeli citizens from the Indian Ocean island archipelago, in turn prompting a warning from Israel's foreign ministry that its citizens should avoid the country.\n\nAbout 11,000 Israelis visited the Maldives last year - less than 1% of all tourist arrivals.\n\nMore than 36,000 people have been killed across Gaza since the start of the conflict, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nThe war began in October when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 252 back to Gaza as hostages.\n\nIn the US, President Biden has faced growing domestic criticism over the level of US support for Israel, as well as calls to do more to encourage the warring sides to negotiate.",

            "summary": "A six-week ceasefire, full Israeli withdrawal and plans to reconstruct Gaza are all part of the plan.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is pressuring leaders on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to reach an agreement with a new three-phase ceasefire plan released by the White House on Friday.\n\nOver the weekend, an aide for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country had accepted a framework agreement for winding down its ongoing military campaign in Gaza, while insisting that the proposal put forth by Biden was “not a good deal” and that \"there are a lot of details to be worked out.\"\n\nThe plan arrives eight months after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks that left an estimated 1,200 dead in Israel. Since then, over 36,000 Palestinians and more than 600 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the ongoing war, while an estimated 84 people are still being held hostage in Gaza, according to multiple news outlets.\n\nBiden’s plan calls for a ceasefire, the release of both Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners as well as the reconstruction of Gaza, which has seen 75% of its population displaced because of the war.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about Biden’s three-phase plan and how Israeli and Palestinian leaders are responding to it.\n\n💡 Phase 1: A 6-week ceasefire\n\nThe first phase calls for an immediate “full and complete ceasefire” lasting for six weeks. It will also demand the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza as well as the release of “a number of hostages” — including women, the elderly, the wounded and several U.S. citizens — in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.\n\nDuring this time, “humanitarian assistance would surge with 600 trucks carrying aid into Gaza every single day,” said Biden, who added that the ceasefire will continue even if negotiations last longer than the planned six weeks. The U.S., Egypt and Qatar will also work together to ensure “all the agreements are reached.”\n\n💡💡 Phase 2: The release of all hostages and full Israeli withdrawal\n\nThe second phase calls for the Israeli military to fully withdraw from Gaza in exchange for the release of all remaining living hostages — including male soldiers. If Hamas abides by everything outlined in the plan, Biden explained, Israel said it may agree to the “cessation of hostilities permanently,” meaning that all warfare and violence will be stopped indefinitely.\n\n💡💡💡 Phase 3: The reconstruction of Gaza\n\nThe final phase of the plan is for Gaza to undergo “a major reconstruction” to rebuild its cities — including homes, schools and hospitals that were destroyed by warfare, said Biden. Arab nations and the international community would also participate in a manner that “does not allow Hamas to rearm.”\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (Abir Sultan/Pool Photo via AP)\n\n💯 Netanyahu wants all or nothing\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said on Friday that it had “authorized” the text of Biden’s proposal.\n\nBut Netanyahu stressed on Saturday that Israel would not agree to a ceasefire unless Hamas’s military and governing capabilities are totally destroyed, all hostages are freed and “Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel.” To suggest an immediate ceasefire without those goals is a “non-starter,” Netanyahu said in a statement on X.\n\nNetanyahu’s chief foreign policy adviser, Ophir Falk, clarified the statement with Britain’s Sunday Times, reiterating that Israel’s conditions for a ceasefire “have not changed” and that while Biden’s plan “is not a good deal,” they’re hoping for a swift solution.\n\n👍👎 Israeli leaders are divided\n\nFar-right leaders — Israeli’s Minister of Finance Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir — agree with Netanyahu that an immediate ceasefire should be contingent on the destruction of Hamas. If the prime minister moves forward with the plan, Ben-Gvir said in a post on X, Israel’s far-right Otzma Yehudit party would make plans to “dissolve the government.”\n\nMeanwhile, Israel’s War Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz and opposition leader Yair Lapid support the plan and have urged Israeli leaders to discuss “next steps” as soon as possible, reports the Times of Israel.\n\nGantz had previously threatened to step down by June 8 if no plan for a ceasefire was agreed upon.\n\nBenny Gantz, a key member of Israel's war Cabinet and the top political rival of Netanyahu. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\n➕ Hamas views Biden's plan 'positively'\n\nOn Friday, Hamas said that it viewed Biden’s plan “positively” and that its willingness to move forward with it is solely “based on a permanent ceasefire” and the “complete withdrawal” of Israeli forces from Gaza, according to the Washington Post.\n\n❓ Who else supports Biden's plan?\n\nThe United States, Egypt and Qatar released a joint statement on Saturday supporting the plan, saying that it would bring “immediate relief both to the long-suffering people of Gaza as well as the long-suffering hostages and their families.”\n\nFamily members of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza have called on Netanyahu to publicly support Biden’s plan, reports Al Jazeera, with the Hostage and Missing Families Forum urging “citizens of Israel to take to the streets” to ensure it happens.\n\nOn a call with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan on Friday night, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken “emphasized that Hamas should accept the deal and that every country with a relationship with Hamas should press it to do so without delay.”",

            "summary": "CNN —\n\nTwo far-right Israeli ministers have threatened to resign and bring down the governing coalition of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he accepts a peace proposal laid out by US President Joe Biden.\n\nBiden unveiled on Friday what he said was a three-phase Israeli proposal to end the conflict in Gaza that would pair a release of hostages with a “full and complete ceasefire.”\n\nDuring a speech at the White House, Biden said Hamas had been degraded to a point where it could no longer carry out the type of attack seen on October 7 that launched the current war in Gaza.\n\n“It’s time for this war to end,” he said, a clear indication that – as far as he is concerned – Israel’s war goals have been met.\n\nBut the Israeli government’s two most prominent far-right members, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, made it explicitly clear they reject an immediate ceasefire. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also signaled he is not ready either, casting doubt over Biden’s proposal.\n\nIn a statement on social media, Smotrich said he had “made it clear” to Netanyahu that he would not “be part of a government that will agree to the proposed outline and end the war without destroying Hamas and returning all the hostages.”\n\nSmotrich demanded the fighting to continue until the “destruction of Hamas and the return of all the hostages,” as well as the “creation of a completely different security reality in Gaza and Lebanon.”\n\nNational Security Minister Ben Gvir meanwhile described the deal as “reckless” and “a victory for terrorism,” as well as a security danger to Israel.\n\n“If the prime minister implements the reckless deal under the conditions published today, which mean the end of the war and the giving up on the elimination of Hamas, Otzma Yehudit will dissolve the government,” he said, referring to the far-right party he leads and which helps prop up Netanyahu’s majority in parliament.\n\nBiden had alluded to the tensions in the Israeli government in his speech, making a direct appeal to ordinary Israelis to voice their support.\n\n“I know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan and will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some, some are even in the government coalition,” he said.\n\nNetanyahu under pressure\n\nThe proposal would first see hostages freed and Israel withdrawing from “all populated areas of Gaza,” and eventually culminate in a reconstruction plan for Gaza, which has been left in ruins from the fighting.\n\nThe plan has been widely welcomed, with the UN and other international powers urging Israel and Hamas to accept it.\n\nHamas said it viewed the plan “positively” and was ready “to deal positively and constructively with any proposal based on a permanent ceasefire.”\n\nLess than an hour after Biden detailed the proposal, Netanyahu insisted Israel will not end the war in Gaza until it had achieved all of its goals, including the destruction of Hamas.\n\nThe extent to which Netanyahu agrees with the plan is unclear, as the statement also said that the “exact outline” of Israel’s proposal allows Israel to “maintain these principles.”\n\nOn Sunday, the Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant warned Israel will “not accept” any deal to end the war which would allow Hamas to rule over Gaza. During a visit to the Israeli military’s Southern Command headquarters on Sunday, Gallant said options for a “governing alternative to Hamas” are being considered.\n\n“We will not accept the rule of Hamas in Gaza at any stage in any process aimed at ending the war,” Gallant said, according to a readout from his office.\n\nHowever, Hamas has made it clear it will not accept any other group governing Gaza. On May 16, the group’s political leader Ismail Haniyeh noted that, in regards to “the day after the war,” there had been “calls to remove Hamas.”\n\n“We say that Hamas is here to stay,” Haniyeh responded.\n\nOn Sunday the White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the administration was currently “waiting for an official response from Hamas” on the Israeli ceasefire proposal.\n\nPressed on whether there would be a situation in which Hamas would agree to the proposal but Israel would not, speaking on ABC’s “This Week” Kirby said that the Biden administration has “every expectation” that Israel would agree.\n\n“We have every expectation that if Hamas agrees to the proposal, as was transmitted to them, an Israeli proposal, that Israel would say yes,” Kirby added.\n\nNetanyahu faces pressure from more than just within his own coalition. On Saturday protesters again took to the streets, demanding his resignation and early elections.\n\nIsraeli opposition leader Yair Lapid has offered to back Netanyahu in accepting the proposal, and condemned the comments by Smotrich and Ben Gvir.\n\n“The threats of Ben Gvir and Smotrich are the neglect of national security, of the hostages and of the residents of the north and the south,” he said.\n\n“This is the worst and most reckless government in the country’s history. For them, there will be a war here forever, zero responsibility, zero management, a complete failure.\n\nNetanyahu’s government is facing growing international calls to end the war in Gaza as the conflict approaches its ninth month.\n\nThe war was triggered by Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians on October 7, which left around 1,200 people dead and saw more than 200 people taken hostage. The Israeli campaign in Gaza since then has killed more than 36,000 people.",

            "summary": "South Africa president faces up to poor poll result\n\n12 hours ago Lou Newton , Nomsa Maseko Share\n\n\"The results reflect the will of the people,\" says President Ramaphosa\n\nSouth Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has admitted his African National Congress (ANC) party has suffered a challenging election result, after the party lost its majority for the first time since apartheid ended 30 years ago. The ANC, once led by Nelson Mandela, won 159 seats in the 400-seat parliament in Wednesday's election, down from 230 in the previous assembly. Mr Ramaphosa still described the results as a victory for democracy, calling on rival parties to find common ground - apparently preparing for coalition talks. The opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) party has said it is open to coalition talks with Mr Ramaphosa, but it opposes a number of his government's key priorities. With all the votes counted, the ANC finished on 40% - down from 58% at the previous election, the electoral commission announced on Sunday. This was lower than the party's feared worst-case scenario of 45%, analysts said. The ANC now must go into a coalition to form the next government.\n\n\"Our people have spoken, whether we like it or not, they have spoken,\" Mr Ramaphosa said. \"As the leaders of political parties, as all those who occupy positions of responsibility in society, we have heard the voices of our people and we must respect their wishes.\" He added that the voters wanted the parties to find common ground. \"Through their votes, they have demonstrated clearly and plainly that our democracy is strong and it is enduring,\" he said. South Africa's political parties will be aiming to work out a coalition deal within two weeks, when the new parliament sits for the first time. Can the ANC reinvent itself after dismal result?\n\nWho's up, who's down - and why The centre-right DA remains the second-largest party in parliament with 87 seats, and has said it is open to talks of a coalition. \"We urge all others who love our constitution and all it represents to set aside petty politics and narrow sectarian interests and join hands now,\" DA leader John Steenhuisen said. However, his party opposes two of the ANC's key priorities - its black empowerment policies, which aim to giving black people a stake in the economy following their exclusion during the racist apartheid era, and the National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill, which promises universal healthcare for all. The ANC has said both policies are non-negotiable in coalition talks. Former president Jacob Zuma, who now leads the uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party that came third with 58 seats, did not attend the results announcement and had suggested that he might challenge them. The MK has said it would be prepared to work with the ANC, but not while it was led by Mr Ramaphosa. He replaced Mr Zuma as both president and ANC leader following a bitter power struggle in 2018. In a BBC interview, Patrick Gaspard, who was the US ambassador to South Africa in 2013-16, described the two politicians as \"sworn enemies\". Earlier on Sunday, Mr Zuma called for an election rerun and said the electoral commission should not announce the final results. On Saturday, he warned the commission that it would \"be provoking us\" if it ignored his demand for a fresh election, and for an independent investigation into his party's claims that it was rigged. \"Don’t start trouble when there is no trouble,” he said. There are now concerns over how Mr Zuma's supporters may respond to the results.\n\nThe 82-year-old has been the political wildcard in this election - and he is preparing to flex his muscles as the kingmaker in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal, where the MK party has wrestled a huge chunk of votes from the ANC. Formed just a few months ago, it was the biggest party in the province - getting 44% to the ANC's 19%. Local issues could have been a big factor in that shift, with some community members turning their backs on the ANC because it had failed to fix acute water shortages. Parts of the province, such as Trenance Park, which is a mere 20 minutes' drive from the main city of Durban, have had no tap water for 10 months. Residents rely on water tankers that sometimes do not deliver water on time. People in KwaZulu-Natal hope that now the election is over, the problem will be fixed for good.\n\nEarlier, South Africa's police chief warned that threats to destabilise the country would not be tolerated. \"There cannot be any room for threats of instability in order to register objections or concerns about the electoral processes,\" Police Minister Bheki Cele said at a news conference.",

            "title": "South Africa’s president urges parties to find common ground in talks after election deadlock",
            "summary": "JOHANNESBURG (AP) — President Cyril Ramaphosa called Sunday for South Africa’s political parties to overcome their differences and find “common ground” to form the first national coalition government in its young democracy.\n\nHis comments came in a speech straight after final election results were announced confirming that no party won a majority in last week’s vote. Unprecedented coalition talks were set to start to find a way forward for Africa’s most industrialized economy.\n\nRamaphosa’s African National Congress party had already lost its 30-year majority after more than 99% of votes were counted by Saturday and showed it couldn’t surpass 50%. The ANC received 40% of the votes in last week’s election in the final count, the largest share.\n\nWithout a majority it will need to agree on a coalition with another party or parties for the first time to co-govern and reelect Ramaphosa for a second term. South Africa’s national elections decide how many seats each party gets in Parliament and lawmakers elect the president later.\n\n“Our people have spoken,” Ramaphosa said. “Whether we like it or not, they have spoken. We have heard the voices of our people and we must respect their choices and their wishes. ... The people of South Africa expect their leaders to work together to meet their needs. This is a time for all of us to put South Africa first.”\n\nThe ANC was the party of Nelson Mandela and freed South Africa from the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994. It had governed with a comfortable majority since then, but this election saw an unprecedented slump in its support as voters deserted the party due to its failure to solve widespread poverty, extremely high unemployment levels and problems with delivering basic government services to many in a nation of 62 million.\n\nThe ANC had said earlier Sunday that it was starting its negotiations with all major parties. More than 50 parties took part in the election, and at least eight had significant shares of the vote. At least 26 of them, including the MK Party led by former President Jacob Zuma, have lodged objections and complaints with the electoral body alleging voting irregularities, which it has promised to address.\n\nANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula said it was open to all negotiations, even with the main opposition Democratic Alliance, which has led the chorus of criticism of the ANC for years but is viewed by many analysts as the most stable coalition option for South Africa.\n\nThe DA won the second most votes with 21.8%, and the two parties would hold a majority together and be able to govern. DA leader John Steenhuisen said his party was also initiating talks with parties. The ANC won 159 seats in the 400-seat Parliament, down from the 230 it won in the last election. The DA increased slightly to 87 seats.\n\nThere is some time pressure for coalition talks to progress and for the uncertainty to be minimized, given that the new Parliament needs to sit for the first time and elect a president within 14 days of the election results being declared.\n\nRamaphosa is seeking a second and final term and Mbalula said his position as leader of the ANC was not in question despite the election result. Mbalula said the ANC would not consider the demands by Zuma’s MK Party that Ramaphosa step down as a condition for talks.\n\n“No political party will dictate terms to us, the ANC. They will not ... You come to us with that demand, forget (it),” Mbalula said.\n\nHe said the ANC would not be arrogant, though. “The elections have humbled us, they have brought us where we are,” he said.\n\nSouth Africa is a leading voice for its continent and for the developing world on the global stage and is due to take over the presidency of the Group of 20 rich and developing nations late this year. It’s the only African nation in that group.\n\n“Everyone is looking to see if South Africa can weather the storm and come out the other side,” political analyst Oscar van Heerden said on the eNCA news network.\n\nAmid many coalition options, the ANC could also join with MK and the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters, although they have been cast as partners that would make investors uneasy. Both have pledged to nationalize parts of South Africa’s economy, including its gold and platinum mines, among the world’s biggest producers.\n\nThe DA has long said it will not work with the EFF and MK, calling them a “doomsday coalition” for South Africa. Steenhuisen, the party’s leader, repeated that stance Sunday in a speech on national television but said his party was starting talks with others and would approach them “with cool heads and open minds.”\n\nPolitical analyst van Heerden said an ANC-DA coalition would “possibly give stability” but there were some within the ANC who would oppose it. Other smaller parties could be involved to dilute it and make it more palatable for the ANC, some commentators said.\n\n“The DA has approached the ANC as the enemy over many, many years,” van Heerden said. “The next few days is going to be a very difficult period. People will have to be mature behind closed doors.”\n\n___\n\nImray reported from Cape Town, South Africa.\n\n___\n\nAP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa",

However, only 16.2 million votes were cast on election day, resulting in a voter turnout of 58.64 percent – the lowest ever in South Africa’s 30-year democratic history.\n\nIn fact, voter turnout has been on a gradual decline in recent years.

He has appealed the ruling.\n\nThe charges were connected to hush money payments made in the weeks before the 2016 election intended to cover up alleged past affairs between Trump and an adult film star, which he has denied.\n\nThe alleged affair with adult film actress Stormy Daniels occurred in 2006, just a year after Trump had married Melania and months after the birth of their son, Barron.\n\n“She’s fine, but I think it’s very hard for her,” Trump said of the former first lady in a “Fox and Friends” interview, adding that “in many ways, it’s tougher on them [his family] than it is me.”\n\n“I have a wonderful wife who has to listen to this stuff all the time. They do that for this reason. They do that, all these salacious names that they put in of these people, and I’m not even allowed to defend myself because of the gag order. Think of it,” Trump said, without specifying who “they” is.\n\n“But they put this stuff in to create havoc. These are bad people,” he continued. “I know everything they’re doing. I know every move they make; I get it.”\n\nTrump said later in the interview that he is “okay” with the possibility of going to prison. He could face up to four years behind bars for the charges, though it is considered unlikely. His sentencing is scheduled for July 11.",

            "title": "Lock Him Up!: Why Donald Trump Should Do Jail Time Before the Election",
            "summary": "Multiple news accounts have cited Trump’s age (he’ll be 78 at sentencing) as a reason not to send him to jail. It’s unusual, apparently, for 78-year-olds who falsify documents in the first degree to get jail time. This thinking requires updating. We also used to think it inadvisable for people older than 75 to run for president. The primary voters have spoken otherwise. If Trump is spry enough to serve a second term, he’s spry enough to do hard time.\n\nNews accounts have also noted that first offenders who falsify documents in the first degree seldom get jail time. Let us pause for a moment to appreciate how remarkable it is that a sociopath like Trump reached the advanced age of 77 before he received his first felony conviction. Bravo, Mr. President! That said, Trump has been pronounced a lawbreaker in too many previous civil proceedings to count. Just this year, Trump was found guilty of sexually abusing and defaming E. Jean Carroll in one such proceeding and defrauding banks in another. This second ruling is especially relevant to the hush money case, given the common theme of deception. Fraud is a persistent refrain in anti-Trump litigation; seven years ago, you’ll recall, Trump paid $25 million to settle fraud claims against his bogus Trump University. Do you seriously expect Justice Merchan not to connect these dots? Past history and character, Eisen wrote, are legitimate matters for a sentencing judge to take into consideration, and in Trump’s case these cry out for jail time.\n\nA final difference is the stakes. In those previous instances where New York State defendants falsified business records, the motive was theft, which is bad. Trump’s falsifications played out on a much larger stage. This crime, Eisen has observed, “could be seen not just as unfortunate personal judgment but also, as Merchan has described it, an attempt ‘to unlawfully influence the 2016 presidential election.’” Trump’s defenders say the New York criminal case was brought for political reasons. Of course it was! Trump’s falsifications may have put him in the White House! That makes Bragg’s decision to proceed with the case more defensible, not less.",

He said on his TalkTV show: “Have you lost your minds, America? What a demeaning way to treat a former president.”\n\nMorgan also said he believes that Trump being found guilty would “almost guarantee” his victory in the forthcoming election and, after news of the verdict broke, the broadcaster claimed that “Trump’s donation websites are crashing”, adding: “My guess is this verdict will propel him back into the White House.”\n\nWatch Apple TV+ free for 7 days New subscribers only. £8.99/mo. after free trial.

He denied the affair and pleaded not guilty to the 34 felony charges.\n\nSpeaking about the verdict while leaving the courthouse, Trump said: “I am a very innocent man”, and called the trial “rigged” and “a disgrace”.\n\nDonald Trump has become the first criminally convicted US president in history. ( Getty Images )\n\nTrump will be sentenced on 11 July, four days before he’s expected to become the Republican’s official presidential candidate.\n\nBut according to CNN chief legal analyst Laura Coates, Trump could face more than a decade in prison as the charges were “stepped up” from misdemeanours to class E felonies because prosecutors said the crimes were carried out in an effort to commit or conceal another crime – these crimes being election conspiracy and campaign finance and tax law violations.",

            "title": "Half of Americans think Trump's guilty verdict was correct, should end campaign: POLL",
            "summary": "A plurality of Americans, 50%, think former President Donald Trump's guilty verdict on all 34 counts in his hush money trial was correct, a new ABC News/Ipsos poll finds, and almost as many, 49%, think he should end his 2024 presidential campaign over the result.\n\nStill, following the historic criminal trial that ended this week in a first-ever conviction of a former president, Trump's favorability has remained stable at 31%, according to the latest ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted using Ipsos' KnowledgePanel. Trump was found guilty of 34 counts on Thursday in his trial related to falsifying business records regarding a payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election in order to keep her quiet about their alleged affair.\n\nThe former president has vowed to appeal, saying on Friday that \"bad people\" had levied the case – and charges– against him.\n\nFormer President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump walks to speak to the press after he was convicted in his criminal trial at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York City, on May 30, 2024. Justin Lane/POOL/AFP via Getty Images\n\nForty-seven percent of Americans said they think the charges against Trump in this case were politically motivated, while 38% say they were not. At the same time, the slight majority at 51%, think Trump intentionally did something illegal in this case. Twelve percent think Trump did something wrong but not intentionally, and 19% believe he did not do anything wrong.\n\nThe proportion of Americans who say Trump should end his presidential campaign as a result of this verdict is 49%, which is similar to findings from an April 2023 ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted shortly after the Manhattan grand jury handed down the indictment against him in this case. In the April 2023 polls, 48% thought he should suspend his campaign because of the indictment.\n\nBiden's favorability rating also remains low and unchanged, according to the new ABC News/Ipsos poll. His favorability rating currently stands at 32% compared to 33% in an ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted in March 2024. Public reaction to Trump's guilty verdict falls along partisan lines. For example, 83% of Democrats think the verdict was correct and 79% think he should end his campaign as a result, while only 16% of Republicans say the verdict was correct and the same percentage say he should end his presidential bid.\n\nBecause both Biden and Trump are broadly viewed unfavorably, the election could come down to independent voters, or even more specifically, those who dislike both candidates – sometimes referred to as double-haters.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump Getty Images\n\nA majority of Independents think Trump's verdict was correct, 52%, and the same amount believe that he should end his candidacy. For double-haters, those reactions are even more pronounced -- 65% of Americans who view both Trump and Biden unfavorably think the verdict this week was correct, with 67% believing Trump should end his presidential campaign.\n\nForty-five percent of Independents and 51% of double-haters think the hush-money trial was politically motivated, compared to 83% of Republicans and 20% of Democrats.\n\nIn the New York trial, Trump's attacks are largely directed at the district attorney, the judge and the jury -- all of which he's claimed are unfairly politically biased against him. Trump has also come after President Biden, claiming without evidence, that he was behind the prosecution.\n\n\"If they can do this to me, they can do this to anyone,\" Trump said during a press conference at Trump Tower in Manhattan. \"These are bad people. These are, in many cases, I believe, sick people.\" Biden, in his own remarks later on Friday, pushed back that the rule of law was \"reaffirmed\" and statements questioning the legitimacy of the process were \"dangerous.\"\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nThis ABC News/Ipsos poll was conducted using the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel® May 31-June 1, 2024, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 781 U.S. adults. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.7 points, including the design effect, for the full sample. Sampling error is not the only source of differences in polls.

Police officers nudged him back onto his side of the protest so as not to escalate an already tense situation.\n\nMarchers in the pro-Israel camp were chanting for the release of hostages taken in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack in southern Israel that triggered the war in Gaza.

In Idaho, the imposition of a death sentence is followed by a mandatory post-conviction review, and defendants are able to pursue an appeal after the filing of a death warrant.\n\nIn the meantime, the high-profile nature of Daybell’s case – and the looming capital trial of Bryan Kohberger, who’s pleaded not guilty in the killings of four University of Idaho college students – will bring renewed attention to Idaho’s death penalty, which is seldom used and attracted headlines earlier this year when officials halted their first execution attempt in more than a decade.\n\nHere’s what to know about the death penalty in Idaho.\n\nExecutions are uncommon\n\nExecutions are relatively rare in Idaho, which, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, has carried out just three executions since 1976, when the US Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment. The first was in 1994, followed by two others in 2011 and 2012.\n\nTo put this in context, Texas has put to death 580 inmates within the timeframe, DPIC’s data show – by far the most of any state. And Oklahoma, which has carried out the highest number of executions per capita, has executed 124.\n\nOnly a handful of the 27 states where the death penalty remains legal have carried out as few executions as Idaho: Kentucky, Montana and Pennsylvania have also each put to death three people since 1976. Kansas, Wyoming and Oregon have executed even fewer, with zero, one and two executions, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, Idaho’s death row housed just eight inmates prior to Daybell’s sentence, according to the Idaho Department of Corrections. California – which, it should be noted, has a population more than 21 times the size of Idaho – has 638 condemned inmates, nearly 80 times the size of Idaho’s death row.\n\nOfficials recently halted an execution\n\nIdaho officials attempted to carry out the state’s first execution in 12 years several months ago. But they were forced to abort midway through the procedure, citing difficulties setting an intravenous line to deliver the fatal drugs for lethal injection.\n\nThat echoed difficulties seen in executions in other states, including Alabama. Officials there similarly had to call off two executions in 2022 after authorities were unable to access the inmates’ veins before their death warrants expired.\n\nThe execution of Thomas Creech, scheduled in Idaho for February 28, was “unable to proceed” after eight failed attempts to establish IV access, state Department of Correction Director Josh Tewalt said at the time. The execution team encountered two different issues, Tewalt said at a news conference: In some instances it was “an access issue,” and in others a “vein quality issue.”\n\nTewalt praised the medical team’s willingness to halt the execution, telling reporters the state’s “first objective is to carry this out with dignity, professionalism and respect,” and he disputed the suggestion the execution was a “failure.” The department said in a statement Creech’s warrant would expire while the state considered next steps.\n\nThe Idaho State prison complex near Kuna is shown on February 28, the day officials halted the execution of Thomas Creech after they failed to find a vein to establish an IV line to carry out the lethal injection. Kyle Green/AP\n\n2 execution methods, both with challenges\n\nThe decision to call off Creech’s execution also raised questions about when and how the state would endeavor to put an inmate to death in the future.\n\nTewalt told reporters a second attempt using lethal injection – Idaho’s main method of execution – would require the state to seek out new chemicals.\n\nWhile he expressed “a high level of confidence” the state could secure the drugs, a number of states have struggled in recent years to obtain them after pharmaceutical companies began prohibiting the use of their products for that purpose. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, for example, has repeatedly postponed executions citing companies’ unwillingness to sell the drugs necessary.\n\nIdaho recently legalized a second method of execution, with an aim toward sidestepping this kind of supply problem. Last year, Gov. Brad Little signed a new law allowing the department of corrections to use the firing squad if the drugs are not available.\n\nBut as of late February, the state lacked the facilities it needed to carry out an execution by firing squad, Tewalt said. In a message to corrections staff, the director said his department had been working to retrofit its execution chamber to accommodate the alternative method.\n\n“Those initial efforts were unsuccessful because contractors who would engage in this type of work have expressed their unwillingness to work on a project related to executions,” Tewalt said, “but efforts are ongoing.”\n\nThe director added construction on the execution chamber would prevent the state from being able to use it – even for lethal injection – until the work is completed.",

            "summary": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. – \"Doomsday mom\" Lori Vallow's sister, Summer Shiflet, on Saturday spoke out publicly for the first time since an Idaho jury convicted Chad Daybell in his triple murder case on Friday.\n\nShiflet's comments came at CrimeCon 2024 — a true crime convention that brings victims, law enforcement and other criminal justice experts together to share their stories — in Nashville on Saturday afternoon, just hours after an Idaho judge sentenced Vallow's husband, Chad Daybell, to death following his nine-count conviction.\n\n\"I had no expectations … but when I heard those words, it was everything I needed to hear,\" Shiftleft told East Idaho News Director Nate Eaton of Daybell's death sentence during their panel at CrimeCon, thanking law enforcement and prosecutors for their work in convicting the couple.\n\nVallow, 50, and Daybell, 55, have both been convicted of three counts of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, insurance fraud and grand theft. The couple, who shared extreme apocalyptic, cult-like religious views, murdered two of Vallow's children, 7-year-old J.J. Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan, as well as Daybell's first wife, Tammy Daybell, in 2019. Vallow was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Daybell may face a firing squad under Idaho law.\n\nCHAD DAYBELL SENTENCED TO DEATH IN IDAHO FOR MURDER OF LORI VALLOW'S 2 CHILDREN, FIRST WIFE\n\nSummer Shiflet pictured with her sister Lori Vallow, now a convicted murderer.\n\n\"They did not deserve what happened to them,\" Shiftlet said of her niece and nephew.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut prosecutors have argued in both Vallow's and Daybell's cases that the desire for \"money, power and sex\" is what drove the duo to kill Vallow's two children and Daybell's first wife. Vallow and Daybell also stole J.J. and Tylee's Social Security benefits between Oct. 1, 2019, when they disappeared, and Jan. 22, 2020, after they were murdered.\n\nCHAD DAYBELL VERDICT: JURY FINDS DOOMSDAY AUTHOR GUILTY OF MURDERING LORI VALLOW'S KIDS, FIRST WIFE\n\nThe two children were found dead in shallow graves on Chad Daybell's Rexburg, Idaho, property in June 2020, months after they disappeared from their home in September 2019. The 16-year-old's remains were burned while the 7-year-old was bound in duct tape.\n\nThe Ada County coroner testified that J.J. died of asphyxiation by a plastic bag and Tylee died of homicide by unknown means due to the fact that her remains were dismembered and badly burned before they were buried.\n\nLORI VALLOW TRIAL: ‘CULT MOM’ SENTENCED IN MURDERS OF 2 OF HER CHILDREN, HUSBAND'S FIRST WIFE\n\nLori and Chad Daybell are accused of killing 17-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old J.J. Vallow in 2019.\n\nAfter their children disappeared, Vallow and Daybell ran off to Hawaii to get married. Authorities arrested Vallow in February 2020 and Daybell in June 2020.\n\nLISTEN TO LORI VALLOW'S JAIL CALL WITH HER SISTER:\n\nAt Vallow's sentencing, Judge Steven Boyce told the so-called \"cult mom\" that she has \"mental health issues,\" including diagnoses such as \"delusional disorder\" mixed with \"hyper-religiosity\" and a \"continuous and unspecified personality disorder\" with narcissistic features.\n\nLORI VALLOW TRIAL: IDAHO CORONER REVEALS JJ VALLOW AND TYLEE RYAN'S CAUSE OF DEATH\n\nShiflet said Saturday that she believes her sister is still under the delusion that her children are somehow not missing and in a better place.\n\n\"One thing for me, personally, in coming to understand why this happened, which is a huge question, is: how does your sister and this mother … get to this point from a one-year period from meeting Chad Daybell to having your kids murdered,\" Shiflet said during the CrimeCon panel. \"How does that happen? How do you get to that point? So, for me, it's been helpful to understand her diagnosis and to understand that … her reality is as real to her as our reality is to us. And she 100% thinks she is sane. She does not think there is anything wrong with her.\"\n\nShe added that Vallow would rather be in prison than hospitalized for her mental health disorders.\n\n\"She doesn't think she's done anything wrong,\" Shiflet said.\n\nHAWAII POLICE SERVE SUBPOENA TO BIKINI-CLAD LORI VALLOW RELAXING POOLSIDE: VIDEO\n\nSummer Shiflet said she believes her sister, Lori Vallow, still believes she did nothing wrong even after her conviction in her children's murders.\n\nShiflet also addressed comments she made in 2020 after her sister's arrest when she and her mother went on national television to defend Vallow. She acknowledged that she was wrong at the time because she simply did not believe her sister to be capable of murdering her own children.\n\nShiflet described her sister as a loving mother and sister prior to her relationship with Daybell and her delusions. She also mentioned that she and Vallow have experienced a lot of death in their family, and she believes something eventually cracked in Vallow, leading her to believe the deaths were occurring for a specific reason.\n\nDuring her sentencing in August 2023, Vallow told the courtroom that her deceased children were \"happy\" and \"busy.\"\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"I have had many communications with Jesus Christ, savior of this world, and our heavenly parents. I have had many angelic visitors have come and communicated with me and even manifested themselves to me because of these communications,\" Vallow said at the time. \"I know for a fact that my children are happy and busy in the spirit world. Because of my communications with my friend, Tammy Daybell, I know that she is also very happy and extremely busy.\"\n\nSIGN UP TO GET TRUE CRIME NEWSLETTER\n\nShe added that she has \"always mourned the loss\" of her \"loved ones\" and has \"lost many in this mortal world\" with whom she believes she is still in communication in the spirit world.\n\nSummer Shiflet said her sister, Lori Vallow, would rather be in prison than a hospital for her mental health disorders.\n\nDaybell has written several apocalyptic novels based loosely on Mormon theology. Both he and Vallow were involved in a group that promotes preparedness for the biblical end of times.\n\nOfficials extradited Vallow to Arizona in November 2023 in a separate case, where she faces one first-degree murder charge and one premeditated first-degree murder charge in Maricopa County.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal article source: Lori Vallow's sister reacts to Chad Daybell's death sentence: 'Everything I needed to hear'",

Buzbee has been with The Washington Post since 2021, leading the newsroom through the turbulence of the pandemic and expanding its service journalism, including Climate and Well+Being. Under her leadership, The Washington Post has won significant awards, including the recent Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting.\n\nMatt Murray, former Editor in Chief of The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), will replace Buzbee as Executive Editor until the 2024 U.S presidential election, after which Robert Winnett, Deputy Editor of The Telegraph Media Group, will take on the new role of Editor at The Washington Post, responsible for overseeing our core coverage areas, including politics, investigations, business, technology, sports and features.\n\nThe Washington Post also announced today its intention to launch a new division of the newsroom dedicated to better serving audiences who want to consume and pay for news differently from traditional offerings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis third newsroom will be comprised of service and social media journalism and run separately from the core news operation. The aim is to give the millions of Americans – who feel traditional news is not for them but still want to be kept informed –compelling, exciting and accurate news where they are and in the style that they want.\n\nThis new organizational structure follows The Washington Post’s recent announcement of its ‘Build It’ plan, which highlights the need to move away from the traditional one-size-fits-all approach and to create news for a broader range of readers and customers. This will focus more on video storytelling, embracing AI to help, and flexible payment methods. The new newsroom division will be operational by the third quarter of this year.\n\nThe move will also allow the core news division to focus on growing The Post subscriber base and building a new suite of professional products – Pro, Plus and Membership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Sally is an incredible leader and a supremely talented media executive who will be sorely missed. I wish her all the best going forward,\" said William Lewis, CEO and Publisher of The Washington Post.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nMurray will join as Executive Editor, effective immediately. He worked at The Wall Street Journal for 29 years, eventually leading its 1,300-person newsroom as well as overseeing the publication’s editorial strategy and operations. Under Murray’s tenure, The Wall Street Journal doubled its digital traffic and subscriptions, and achieved record growth in video and audio audiences as it expanded across all platforms.\n\n“I’m deeply honored to join such a storied news institution with its long, rich history of memorable and impactful journalism and want to thank Sally for her great leadership,” said Murray. “I am excited by Will and Jeff’s vision for The Post’s next era of growth and reinvention and can’t wait to get started.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis fall, Winnett will take on the new role of Editor at The Washington Post, responsible for overseeing its core coverage areas, including politics, investigations, business, technology, sports and features. He will transition into the role leading up to the election. On November 6th, Murray will begin his role as leader of the third newsroom.\n\nWinnett has an excellent track record in investigative reporting, delivering scoops and leading significant newsroom transformations. He has run Telegraph Media Group’s news operations since 2013 and has overseen the introduction of Britain's first fully integrated 24-hour, seven-day news operation covering digital platforms and The Daily and Sunday Telegraph newspapers.\n\n\"By creating three, strong, journalism functions – Core, Service/Social and Opinions – we are taking a definitive step away from the 'one size fits all' approach and moving towards meeting our audiences where they are,” said Lewis.",

            "summary": "New York CNN —\n\nThe Washington Post announced on Sunday that it had parted ways with its top editor, Sally Buzbee, in a seismic shakeup executed by new publisher and chief executive William Lewis just months before the high-stakes 2024 presidential election.\n\n“Sally is an incredible leader and a supremely talented media executive who will be sorely missed,” Lewis said in a statement. “I wish her all the best going forward.”\n\nWhile Lewis praised Buzbee publicly on Sunday, she oversaw a particularly tumultuous period at the venerable newspaper. During her three-year tenure, The Post saw much of its audience dissipate.\n\nWhile The Post celebrated several journalism triumphs under Buzbee, winning numerous awards, her tenure was also stained by severe infighting in 2022 that spurred national headlines and embarrassed the newspaper.\n\nThe Post said that Matt Murray, former editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal, will immediately replace Buzbee as executive editor. Murray will serve in that position through the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAfter the November election, Robert Winnett, deputy editor of The Telegraph Media Group, will take on a new role as editor of The Post, overseeing its core news offering. Murray will then transition to overseeing the formation of a new newsroom at The Post, one which focuses on service and social media journalism.\n\nLewis said the creation of an additional newsroom division represents a “definitive step away from the ‘one size fits all’ approach and moving towards meeting our audiences where they are.”\n\nThe changes to leadership come as Lewis moves quickly to turn around The Post, which soared with audience growth during the chaotic Donald Trump presidency but has since struggled to find its footing.\n\nLewis, who unveiled the main contours of his revival plan last month, disclosed to staffers that the newspaper lost $77 million last year and 50% of its audience since 2020.\n\n“To speak candidly,” Lewis told staffers during a 90-minute meeting, “we are in a hole, and we have been for some time.”\n\nLike Lewis, Murray previously spent much of his career inside Rupert Murdoch’s media empire. Murray worked at The Wall Street Journal for 29 years, stepping down from the top role at the business broadsheet last year.\n\n“I’m deeply honored to join such a storied news institution with its long, rich history of memorable and impactful journalism and want to thank Sally for her great leadership,” Murray said in the statement. “I am excited by Will and Jeff’s vision for The Post’s next era of growth and reinvention and can’t wait to get started.”\n\nThis story had been updated with new information.",

            "title": "Atlanta mayor declares state of emergency following water main breaks, hospital that moved patients resumes normal operations",
            "summary": "CNN —\n\nAtlanta’s mayor has declared a state of emergency following a massive water main break that left parts of the city’s downtown district without water and prompted a major hospital to transfer patients elsewhere.\n\nThe significant disruption to water service in Georgia’s capital is the latest dramatic example of how aging infrastructure throughout the United States has impacted electrical grids, bridges and roadways, dams and other vital systems, inconveniencing millions of Americans or placing them in danger.\n\nAtlanta Mayor Andre Dickens on Saturday declared a state of emergency just a few hours after crews repaired one of two major water main breaks in the city’s downtown area. The other, in the Midtown neighborhood, is still undergoing services with no estimate on when it will be repaired.\n\nRepair crews have made “significant progress in localizing the repairs” as they continue to address the broken water main at the intersection of West Peachtree Street and 11th Street in Midtown, Atlanta’s Department of Watershed Management said early Sunday.\n\nVideo from CNN affiliate WANF showed water gushing from a pipe onto a blocked-off portion of West Peachtree Street as crews worked to address it.\n\nAtlanta Watershed reported another possible water main break in the city earlier Sunday and announced emergency repairs on a 6-inch water main near the Candler Park neighborhood were complete by late Sunday afternoon. Water service was restored to 35 nearby homes and four hydrants, the city agency said.\n\nThe issues began Friday after breaks on a 48-inch and 36-inch transmission line “that carries large volumes of water to the metropolitan area,” according to Atlanta Watershed.\n\nThe water main breaks left parts of downtown Atlanta without water and under boil water advisories, shuttering tourist attractions and forcing events to be postponed.\n\nAfter repairs to the initial water main break downtown were completed, crews fully restored water service to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the Fulton County Jail, Atlanta City Detention Center and other facilities, the city agency said.\n\nCrew members look at a broken water transmission line on Saturday, June 1, in Atlanta. Mike Stewart/AP\n\nOn Sunday, the city distributed water at two city fire stations, limiting cases to one per resident amid ongoing water issues. “We are currently working on getting more water delivered to all stations,” the City of Atlanta said in a post on X.\n\nMeanwhile, the city’s Emory University Hospital Midtown and its ambulances resumed normal operations Sunday after the hospital experienced water pressure issues due to the water main breaks on Saturday, according to Janet Christenbury, director of media relations.\n\nThe disruptions prompted the hospital on Saturday to transfer dialysis patients to other hospitals and divert ambulances from its emergency department, except for people with urgent heart concerns, a hospital spokesperson told CNN in a statement.\n\n“Tomorrow, we will operate on regular schedules for outpatient doctor’s appointments, procedures and surgeries,” Christenbury said in a statement.\n\nThe hospital said it brought in around 58,000 gallons of water in six tanker trucks to use in chillers and cooling towers on Saturday and distributed bottled water to patients for drinking and personal care needs.\n\n“We will continue to provide bottled water to patients, visitors and staff while the hospital remains under a boil water advisory, like many of the affected areas in Atlanta,” Christenbury said.\n\nUrgent surgeries were not affected on Saturday, the hospital said.\n\nBoil water advisory in still effect\n\nDickens apologized on Saturday for the city’s response to the water main break that began creating concerns Friday morning.\n\n“I know it has been a tough and frustrating day for many of you,” Dickens said. “We all take this matter very seriously.”\n\nThe issues prompted the closure of tourist attractions and the rescheduling of events including Megan Thee Stallion concerts Friday and Saturday. The incident also left many without water or with inadequate water pressure.\n\nThe Georgia Aquarium and the World of Coca-Cola, two of downtown’s biggest attractions, remained closed Saturday.\n\nAtlanta United, the city’s soccer team, said it planned to play its match against Charlotte FC on Sunday at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, but there would be “limited food and beverage options” due to the city’s boil water advisory, which remained in effect.\n\n“We ask all fans to utilize hand sanitizing stations around the stadium as an added precaution for health and safety,” the team said in a statement on X.\n\nOfficials say a decaying pipe that collapsed due to water pressure was the main cause of the break downtown.\n\n“We were actually able to repair the fitting that was leaking,” said Al Wiggins Jr., Commissioner for the Department of Public Works, during a news conference on Saturday.\n\n“We spent a significant amount of time removing pressure from the system in order for us to be able to conduct the necessary repairs,” he said.\n\nCrews are slowly pressurizing water flow to ensure no additional damage is done to the water network.\n\nAtlanta’s Grady Memorial Hospital, which reported low water pressure on Saturday, is expected to return to normal operations Monday after water service was restored and water pressure has “significantly increased,” Grady’s administration announced Sunday.\n\nAl Wiggins Jr., Atlanta’s Commissioner for the Department of Public Works, speaks at a news conference in Atlanta on Saturday, June 1. WANF\n\nThe hospital, which said it remained fully operational on Saturday, said it would also continue providing patients and staff with bottled water Sunday amid the ongoing boil water advisory.\n\nWater issues have impacted Atlanta before. In June 2020, a water main break on the Georgia Institute of Technology’s campus led to outages and a boil water advisory in the city.\n\nEmory University Hospital Midtown used bottled water then. Patient care was not affected.\n\nAtlanta’s woes are part of a larger issue of aging infrastructure throughout the US. Here and in Canada, around 260,000 water main breaks cost $2.6 billion each year, according to a December 2023 study from Utah State University.\n\nThe study noted the average age of failing water mains is around 53 years and that 33% of US and Canadian water mains are over 50 years old.\n\nCNN’s Ray Sanchez and Rafael Romo contributed to this report.",

            "summary": "North Korea said Sunday it will stop sending trash-filled balloons into South Korea, after the democratic nation pledged to take “unbearable” steps in retaliation.\n\nA North Korean vice defense minister, Kim Kang II, said Sunday that his country sent the balloons in response to South Korea’s previous leaflet campaigns, which often spread critical messaging of North Korean leaders among the people who live in the authoritarian country and who, therefore, lack access to outside news.\n\nKim said the country was prepared to resume sending trash-filled balloons if South Korea resumed its anti-Pyongyang leaflet campaign in North Korea.\n\n“We made the [Republic of Korea] clans get enough experience of how much unpleasant they feel and how much effort is needed to remove the scattered wastepaper,” Kim said in a statement carried by North Korean state media, The Associated Press (AP) reported.\n\nEarlier Sunday, South Korea pledged to respond to the provocations with “unbearable” steps, which, the AP reported, experts predicted could include front-line loudspeaker broadcasts into the North. Experts predicted the broadcasts would be directed toward North Korean civilians, criticizing their authoritarian government’s track record on human rights violations, reporting on world news and playing K-pop songs.\n\nSouth Korea’s military said it discovered more than 700 balloons sent from North Korea on Sunday, after finding 260 earlier this week. The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said the balloons were tied to manure, wastepaper and other trash. North Korea said they had flown 3,500 balloons carrying 15 tons of wastepaper.\n\nSouth Korean officials said the “unbearable” retaliatory steps would be a reaction to the balloons, as well as to the alleged jamming of GPS signals in South Korea and to the North’s simulation of nuclear strikes against the South in recent days.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed reporting.",

            "title": "South Korea plans to nullify peace deal to punish North Korea over trash-carrying balloon launches",
            "summary": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea announced Monday it’ll suspend a rapprochement deal with North Korea to punish it over its launches of trash-carrying balloons, even after the North said it would halt its balloon campaign.\n\nOver several days, North Korea flew hundreds of balloons to drop trash and manure on South Korea in an angry reaction against previous South Korean civilian leafleting campaigns. On Sunday, South Korea said it would take “unbearable” retaliatory steps in response, before North Korea abruptly announced it would stop flying balloons across the border.\n\nOn Monday, South Korea’s presidential national security council said it has decided to suspend a 2018 inter-Korean agreement aimed at easing frontline animosities, until mutual trust between the two Koreas is restored, according to the presidential office.\n\nThe security council said the suspension would allow South Korea to resume military drills near the border with North Korea and take effective, immediate responses to provocations by North Korea. It said a proposal on the suspension will be introduced at the Cabinet Council on Tuesday for approval.\n\nObservers say South Korea needs the deal’s suspension to restart blasting anti-Pyongyang propaganda broadcasts, K-pop songs and outside news from border loudspeakers. They say such broadcasts have previously stung in the rigidly controlled North, where most of its 26 million people are not allowed official accesses to foreign news.\n\nThe 2018 agreement, reached during a brief period of reconciliation between then-liberal South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, require the Koreas to cease all hostile acts against each other, including propaganda broadcasts and leafleting campaigns.\n\nBut the accord doesn’t clearly state civilian leafleting should also be banned. That has allowed South Korean activists to continue to fly balloons to drop anti-Pyongyang leaflets, USB sticks with South Korean dramas and world news, and U.S. dollars in North Korea. Enraged over such leafleting campaigns, North Korea has previously fired at incoming balloons and destroyed a South Korean-built, unoccupied inter-Korean liaison office in the North.\n\nThe 2018 deal has already been in the danger of collapsing. Tension spiked after North Korea’s spy satellite launch last November prompted both Koreas to take steps in breach of the accord — South Korea resuming frontline aerial surveillance and North Korea restoring border guard posts.\n\nSince last Tuesday, a total of about 1,000 North Korean balloons carrying manure, cigarette butts, scraps of cloth and waste paper have been discovered in various parts of South Korea. No hazardous substances were found, according to South Korea’s military.\n\nOn Sunday night, Kim Kang Il, a North Korean vice defense minister, said the North would stop its balloon campaign because it left the South Koreans with “enough experience of how much unpleasant they feel.” He said North Korea will fly balloons again if South Korean activists restart their own balloon activities.\n\nExperts say North Korea’s balloon campaign, reportedly the first of its kind in seven years, is meant to trigger a divide in South Korea over its current conservative government’s tough policy on the North. Since 2022, North Korea has dramatically ramped up its weapons tests in what analysts call an attempt to bolster its nuclear capability and increase its leverage in future diplomacy with the U.S.",

He described those efforts as crucial for countering U.S. and South Korean military activities, state media said Wednesday.\n\nNORTH KOREA FLIES BALLOONS CARRYING GARBAGE OVER SOUTH KOREA FOLLOWING FAILED SATELLITE LAUNCH\n\nThe wire reported observers' claims that South Korea was likely going to restart front-line loudspeaker broadcasts into North Korea, criticizing the country for violating human rights while also broadcasting world news and K-pop songs.\n\nNorth Korean leaders are sensitive to the broadcasts because most of the 26 million people living in the country do not have access to radio programs and foreign television.\n\nKim Kang II, a North Korean vice defense minister, said Sunday that the country would temporarily suspend the balloon activities, adding they were a countermeasure against the South’s leafleting campaigns.\n\n\"We made the ROK (Republic of Korea) clans get enough experience of how much unpleasant they feel and how much effort is needed to remove the scattered wastepaper,\" Kim said in a statement carried by state media.\n\nNORTH KOREA TEST-FIRES SUSPECTED MISSILES AFTER US, SOUTH KOREA CONDUCT FIGHTER JET DRILL\n\nHe also said if South Korean activists send more anti-Pyongyang leaflets via balloons into North Korea again, they will resume flying balloons to dump rubbish hundreds of times the amount of South Korean leaflets found in the North.\n\nSouth Korea’s military said on Sunday that more than 700 balloons were found in various parts of the country, plus another nearly 260 balloons found days earlier.\n\nTied to the balloons, the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, was manure, cigarette butts, scraps of cloth, waste paper and vinyl. No dangerous substances were said to be included.\n\nDespite the South's claims that only about 1,000 balloons were launched, North Korea's vice defense minister said 3,500 balloons were launched carrying 15 tons of waste.\n\nNORTH KOREA ISSUES NUCLEAR 'WARNING SIGNAL' TO US, SOUTH KOREA\n\nChang Ho-jin, South Korea’s national security director, said Sunday that the government decided to take \"unbearable\" measures against North Korea in retaliation for balloon launches, alleged jamming of GPS navigational signals in South Korea and simulation of nuclear strikes against the South.\n\nExperts say North Korea’s balloon campaign, reportedly the first of its kind in seven years, is meant to stoke an internal divide in South Korea over its conservative government’s tough policy on the North.\n\nAnimosity between the Koreas is at its worst level in years as the pace of both Kim's weapons demonstrations and South Korea’s combined military exercises with the U.S. and Japan have intensified since 2022.\n\nThe failed satellite launch was a setback to Kim’s plan to launch three more military spy satellites in 2024 after North Korea’s first military reconnaissance satellite was placed in orbit last November. The November launch followed two failed attempts.\n\nJUSTICE DEPT MAKES ARRESTS IN NORTH KOREA IDENTITY THEFT SCHEME INVOLVING THOUSANDS OF IT WORKERS\n\nNorth Korea has maintained that it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles in the face of what it perceives as U.S.-led military threats. Kim has described spy satellites as crucial for monitoring U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhancing the threat posed by his nuclear-capable missiles.\n\n\"Given the fact that the security environment for our state is undergoing drastic changes owing to U.S. military maneuvers and provocations of all sorts, possessing military reconnaissance satellites presents itself as a prerequisite for our state to bolster up its self-defensive deterrent and safeguard its sovereignty and security from potential threats,\" Kim said.\n\n\"Although we failed to achieve the results we had hoped to get in the recent reconnaissance satellite launch, we must never feel scared or dispirited but make still greater efforts. It is natural that one learns more and makes greater progress after experiencing failure.\"\n\nNorth Korea hasn’t commented on when it would be ready to attempt a satellite launch again, which some experts say could take months.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKim has been boosting the visibility of his ties with Russia in recent months, highlighted by a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in September as they align in the face of their separate confrontations with Washington.\n\nKim’s meeting with Putin was held at a spaceport in the Russian Far East and came after North Korea’s consecutive failures in its attempts to launch its first spy satellite. Putin told Russian reporters at the time that Moscow was willing to help the North build satellites.\n\nThe U.S. and South Korea have also accused North Korea of providing Russia with artillery shells, missiles and other military equipment to help prolong its fighting in Ukraine.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "summary": "A Minnesota county attorney dismissed the charges against a state trooper who fatally shot a Black man during a traffic stop last year, officials announced Sunday afternoon. Trooper Ryan Londregan shot Ricky T. Cobb II, 33, on July 31 and was charged with second-degree unintentional murder, first-degree assault and second-degree manslaughter in January.\n\nCobb had been driving without his lights about 2 a.m. on July 31, officials said in a criminal complaint, when troopers pulled him over. During a brief exchange with troopers who asked Cobb to exit his car, he shifted his car to drive and took his foot off the brake. Shortly afterward, Londregan shot Cobb.\n\nIn a news release Sunday, Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty announced that defense attorneys said Londregan would testify that he thought Cobb was reaching for his firearm. That and other new evidence presented in the case “would make it impossible for the State to prove that Mr. Londregan’s actions were not an authorized use of force by a peace officer,” the news release said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoriarty said in a statement that the case’s dismissal does not “exonerate Mr. Londregan or the methods his supervisors used to train him in difficult situations.”\n\n“There are so many points at which Mr. Londregan could have handled the situation differently, and if he had, Ricky Cobb might still be alive,” Moriarty said. “But that is not the question before us as prosecutors; the only question is whether we can still prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime occurred given this new evidence.”\n\nChristopher Madel, Londregan’s attorney, lauded the decision Sunday in an email to The Washington Post.\n\nIn January, he criticized the charges and called his client a “hero.”\n\n“Open season on law enforcement must end, and it’s going to end with this case,” Madel said in a video statement.\n\nAttorneys for Cobb’s family, who in April filed a lawsuit against Londregan and another trooper who was at the scene, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday evening. The lawsuit alleges unreasonable seizure and excessive use of force against both troopers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Cobb was pulled over last summer, one of the troopers at the scene said Cobb was wanted for “violation of a protective order,” according to the complaint. The troopers asked him to get out of his car. Cobb stayed inside and asked whether they had a warrant to arrest him.\n\nThroughout the conversation, Cobb repeatedly asked why he needed to exit his car.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nAccording to body-camera video, Londregan opened the passenger-side door and a second trooper started to open the driver’s side.

Cobb II, a 33-year-old Black motorist, during a traffic stop on July 31. (Video: Minnesota Department of Public Safety)\n\nLondregan yelled for Cobb to get out of the car again before shooting him twice, according to the complaint. Afterward, Cobb’s car kept moving forward as Londregan and the other trooper lost their footing.\n\nLondregan was the only trooper charged in the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the weeks after Cobb’s death, his family and community members called for the troopers to be fired. At the time, they were placed on administrative leave. The Minnesota State Patrol did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday.\n\nAccording to Sunday’s news release, a trainer for the Minnesota State Patrol said he “never instructed officers to refrain from shooting into a moving vehicle during an extraction, even though that is best practice.” After hearing the new evidence, prosecutors met with a use of force expert, the release said, and decided they could not prove the deadly force was not justified beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nIn a policy recommendation, prosecutors said the Minnesota State Patrol should prohibit troopers from shooting into or from a moving vehicle and require them to submit reports within 48 hours of witnessing one of their colleagues using force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHennepin County was where Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, in 2020. Floyd’s death sparked nationwide protests against police brutality, with demonstrators calling for changes to local and national law enforcement, including defunding agencies and allocating the money for other social resources.\n\nChauvin and three other Minneapolis police officers were convicted of charges related to his killing, including violating his civil rights. Their trials increased scrutiny of how police in Minnesota and elsewhere are trained to use force.\n\nIn a public letter addressed to the Minneapolis community, Moriarty wrote at length about the dismissal, adding that she would explain the decision in a news conference Monday. She ended the letter with an apology to Cobb’s family, writing that he was a “cherished friend” and that she would push for changes.\n\nAt a news conference in August, days after Cobb’s killing, his mother, Nyra Fields-Miller, said she was “very confused and very, very hurt.”\n\n“I want justice for my son,” she said.",

At one point, Gov. Tim Walz expressed his own concern and considered moving the case out of the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office.\n\n“Our community’s going to be hurt. Our community is going to be more divided than ever all because of this decision, horrible decision, that she made.”\n\nThe Hennepin County Attorney’s Office will hold a press conference Monday at 8 a.m. to discuss the decision in more detail.\n\nThe special prosecutors retained in this case developed a detailed report which includes an analysis of the impact of the new evidence. A summary of that report can be viewed below:\n\nMoriarty also released an open letter to the community that can be read below:\n\nAfter the decision was made, Minnesota Republicans Michelle Fischbach, Tom Emmer, Pete Stauber and Brad Finstad released the following statement:\n\n“It was clear months ago that Ms. Moriarty was abusing her position to wrongfully charge Trooper Londregan. When she refused to listen to the facts of the case and the law, we asked Governor Walz to step in and remove the case from her jurisdiction. Finally, after many months of unnecessary strife, Ms. Moriarty has come to the same conclusion that the experts did: that Trooper Londregan was completely justified in his use of force to protect his partner’s life. We still share the same concerns we expressed to the Governor as well as the House Judiciary Committee about Ms. Moriarty’s active work to demonize law enforcement. We are committed to doing everything we can to protect our brave officers from corrupted officials like her.”\n\nThe chief of the Minnesota State Patrol, Col. Christina Bogojevic, also released a statement following the decision:\n\n“Our troopers work hard every day to keep Minnesota safe. They are in a line of work that is increasingly difficult and dangerous — but also more important than ever. The use of force that took Ricky Cobb II’s life unfolded in a fraction of a second. We acknowledge the loss felt by Mr. Cobb’s family. We also recognize the immense toll this incident has taken on our troopers and staff. Following the announcement that charges against Trooper Ryan Londregan were dropped, we move forward with the same passion and commitment to safety and deep appreciation for the public’s support. Trooper Londregan remains on paid leave while we conduct a critical incident review. Due to civil litigation, we cannot provide any additional comments.”\n\nLondregan was charged with unintentional homicide, manslaughter and assault in the shooting death of Ricky Cobb II, who was shot after attempting to drive away from a traffic stop on I-94 last year.\n\nClick here for KSTP’s full Ryan Londregan coverage.",

            "summary": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump falsely claimed in a new interview that he didn’t make a “lock her up” call for the imprisonment of his Democratic opponent of the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump, who faces the possibility of a prison sentence after he was convicted last week on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, was asked in an interview aired Sunday on Fox News about how he had “famously said… ‘lock her up’” in relation to Clinton but did not jail her when he was president.\n\nDuring his answer, Trump said he had decided that imprisoning Clinton “would have been a terrible thing.” Then he added: “I didn’t say ‘lock her up,’ but the people would all say ‘lock her up, lock her up.’”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim that “I didn’t say ‘lock her up’” is false. He called for Clinton’s imprisonment on multiple occasions, including by using the phrase “lock her up.”\n\nTrump often used such rhetoric while criticizing Clinton’s email practices as secretary of state during the Obama administration, which prompted a federal investigation. She was never charged with a crime.\n\nDuring campaign rallies in 2016, Trump sometimes paused his remarks as his supporters engaged in chants of “lock her up,” giving the chants time to continue. On other occasions, he explicitly repeated those words himself.\n\n“For what she’s done, they should lock her up,” Trump said after the crowd chanted “lock her up” at an October 2016 rally in North Carolina.\n\n“‘Lock her up’ is right,” he said at an October 2016 rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump also explicitly called for Clinton’s imprisonment using different phrasing.\n\n“Hillary Clinton has to go to jail, OK? She has to go to jail,” he said in a June 2016 speech in California. “She has to go to jail,” he repeated in an October 2016 speech in Florida. And at a presidential debate in October 2016, after Clinton said, “It’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,” Trump responded, “Because you’d be in jail.”\n\nTrump softened his rhetoric shortly after he defeated Clinton in the election, saying he didn’t want to hurt her and didn’t feel strongly about prosecuting her. In his 2020 campaign for reelection, though, he again made calls to “lock her up.”\n\n“You should lock her up, I’ll tell you,” he said at a January 2020 rally in Ohio. At an October 2020 rally in Georgia, after the crowd chanted “lock them up” in relation to the Biden family, Trump said, “You should lock them up. Lock up the Bidens. Lock up Hillary.”",

Then we won, and I said pretty openly, I’d say, ‘Alright, come on, just relax. Let’s go.

(Though Clinton was under intense scrutiny at the time amid a federal investigation into her classified email scandal, she was never charged with a crime.)\n\n“Every time I mention [Clinton], everyone screams, ‘Lock her up, lock her up,’” Trump said at a July 2016 rally in Colorado. “You know what, I’m starting to agree with you.”\n\nThree months later, he told a North Carolina crowd that “for what she’s done, they should lock her up” and a Pennsylvania audience that “‘lock her up’ is right.”\n\nHe deployed the infamous phrase as recently as 2020.

            "summary": "CNN —\n\nRepublican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump said Sunday that Maryland Republican Senate candidate Larry Hogan “doesn’t deserve the respect” of any Republican after he urged Americans to respect the verdict in Donald Trump’s hush money trial before it was delivered.\n\nSpeaking with CNN’s Kasie Hunt on “State of the Union,” Lara Trump called Hogan’s comments “ridiculous” and said the former Maryland governor “should have thought long and hard” before releasing his statement.\n\n“I’ll tell you one thing, I don’t support what he just said there. I think it’s ridiculous,” Lara Trump, who is also the former president’s daughter-in-law, said. “He doesn’t deserve the respect of anyone in the Republican Party at this point, and quite frankly, anybody in America, if that’s the way you feel. That’s very upsetting to hear that.”\n\nLast week, Hogan had urged Americans to “respect the verdict and the legal process” before a Manhattan jury found Donald Trump guilty of all 34 charges of falsifying business records. The unprecedented and historic verdict makes Trump the first former president in American history to be convicted of a felony.\n\n“At this dangerously divided moment in our history, all leaders—regardless of party—must not pour fuel on the fire with more toxic partisanship. We must reaffirm what has made this nation great: the rule of law,” Hogan had said.\n\nAsked Sunday whether the RNC would withhold money from Hogan’s campaign, Lara Trump declined to answer directly but again called Hogan’s statement “ridiculous.”\n\n“I’ll get back to you on all the specifics monetarily. But what I can tell you is that, as the Republican Party co-chair, I think he should never have said something like that,” she said.\n\nHogan winning the Senate seat in Maryland would be a pickup for Republicans in a Democratic state. He was first elected governor in 2014, comfortably won reelection in 2018 and left office in January 2023 with high approval ratings.\n\nIn recent decades, Maryland has been dominated by the Democratic Party at the state and federal levels. George H.W. Bush was the last Republican presidential nominee to win the Old Line State, in 1988.\n\nLara Trump added Sunday that “the American people have really spoken up” after the hush money conviction.\n\n“The American people came out and in 48 hours after Donald Trump’s verdict was read, our campaign and the RNC raised $70 million in digital fundraising,” she said.\n\n“I think that that was a very quick, very rapid and very strong response from the American people. It has gone way too far,” Lara Trump added. “The American people are upset and they spoke out about it.”",

            "title": "After crackdown on Hong Kong, overseas communities carry the torch to keep Tiananmen memories alive",
            "summary": "HONG KONG (AP) — As the 35th anniversary of Beijing’s Tiananmen Square crackdown neared, Rowena He, a prominent scholar of that bloody chapter of modern China’s history, was busy flying between the United States, Britain and Canada to give a series of talks. Each was aimed at speaking out for those who cannot.\n\nThe 1989 crackdown, in which government troops opened fire on student-led pro-democracy protesters, resulting in hundreds, if not thousands, dead, remains a taboo subject in mainland China. In Hong Kong, once a beacon of commemorative freedom, the massive June 4 annual vigil that mourned the victims for decades has vanished, a casualty of the city’s clampdown on dissidents following huge anti-government protests in 2019.\n\nHe was still reeling from the loss of her academic position after Hong Kong authorities last year rejected her visa renewal, widely seen as a sign of the financial hub’s decline in intellectual freedom. Despite the exhausting schedule of talks, the former protester in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou in 1989 viewed this as her duty.\n\n“We cannot light the candles in Hong Kong anymore. So we would light it everywhere, globally,” she said.\n\nAs Beijing’s toughened political stance effectively extinguished any large-scale commemorations within its borders, overseas commemorative events have grown increasingly crucial for preserving memories of the Tiananmen crackdown. Over the past few years, a growing number of talks, rallies, exhibitions and plays on the subject have emerged in the U.S., Britain, Canada, Australia and Taiwan.\n\nThese activities foster hope and counteract the aggressive efforts to erase reminders of the crackdown, particularly those seen in Hong Kong. In 2021, the city’s police charged three leaders of the group that organized the vigil with subversion under a 2020 sweeping national security law that has all but wiped out public dissent. Later, the group voted to disband. Tiananmen-related statues were also removed from universities.\n\nLast week, under a new, home-grown security law, Hong Kong police arrested seven people on suspicion of alleged sedition over their posting of social media content about commemorating the Tiananmen crackdown. A Christian newspaper, which typically publishes content related to the event ahead of its anniversary, left its front page mostly blank. It said it could only turn words into blank squares and white space to respond to the current situation.\n\nOn Tuesday, the park that used to hold the vigil will be occupied by a carnival held by pro-Beijing groups.\n\nHowever, attempts to silence commemorative efforts have failed to erase the harrowing memories from the minds of a generation of liberal-minded Chinese in the years after tanks rolled into the heart of Beijing to break up weeks of student-led protests that had spread to other cities and were seen as a threat to Communist Party rule.\n\nHe, who was 17 years old at the time, recalls that protesters like her took to the streets out of love for their country. When the crackdown happened, she spent the entire night in front of her TV, unable to sleep. After she returned to school, she was required to recite the official narrative — that the government had successfully quelled a riot — in order to pass her exams.\n\n“I never killed anyone. But I lived with that survivor’s guilt all those years,” she said.\n\nTo preserve memories of the event, a museum dedicated to the Tiananmen crackdown opened in New York last June. It features exhibits such as a blood-stained shirt and a tent used by student protesters.\n\nA similar museum operated by vigil organizers was shuttered in Hong Kong in 2021.\n\nAs of early May, its board chair Wang Dan, also a leading former student leader of the Tiananmen protests, estimated the New York museum attracted about 1,000 people, including Chinese immigrants, U.S. citizens and Hong Kongers. To expand its audience, Wang said he plans to organize temporary exhibitions on university campuses in the U.S., and possibly in other countries over the longer term.\n\nHe said overseas memorial events are crucial because mainland Chinese and Hong Kongers can see overseas memorial activities online.\n\n“It can have an effect in mainland China because young people there all know how to use VPNs to circumvent internet censorship,” he said.\n\nAline Sierp, a professor of European history and memory studies at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, said overseas commemorative activities allow the memories to travel and endure, providing access for other people and future generations.\n\nBut she said it can be “a double-edged sword” because adapting the memories to new places might risk fragmenting or de-contextualizing them in the future.\n\nAlison Landsberg, a memory studies scholar at George Mason University in Virginia, said that overseas efforts carry the potential to inspire people from other places who are facing their own challenges in the pursuit of democracy.\n\nTo carry the memories forward, film and television dramas can be powerful tools for people to take on memories of events through which they didn’t live, she said.\n\nShe said overseas theater productions about the crackdown, which began last year in Taiwan and continued in London this year, have a greater possibility of making those connections and potentially reaching a broader audience.\n\n“When you have a dramatic narrative, you have the capacity to bring the viewer into the story in a kind of intimate way,” Landsberg said.\n\nLast week, members of an audience at a London theater were visibly moved, some to tears, after watching the play “May 35th,” a title that subtly references the June 4 crackdown.\n\nThe play, produced by Lit Ming-wai, part of the Hong Kong diaspora who moved to the U.K. after the enactment of the 2020 security law, tells the story of an elderly couple who wish to properly mourn their son who died in 1989.\n\nIts director, Kim Pearce, who was born in the U.K. in the 1980s, said the tragedy had resonated with her from a young age and she was once moved to tears when she read the poem “Tiananmen” by James Fenton. Working on this project, she said, has further deepened her connection to the stories.\n\nBritish theater-goer Sue Thomas, 64, also found the play deeply moving. “Particularly as a parent myself now, which I wasn’t then, which sort of made me think of it in a much more sort of heartfelt way,” she said.\n\nAt the theater, He, the scholar, served as one of the post-show speakers, sharing her struggles and the motivations behind her work with the audience. She said the play was so powerful that it made her relive the trauma of the past 35 years, leaving her in tears and causing her to lose her contact lenses.\n\n“It shows that how much sufferings that people had to endure all these years,” she said. “If there’s anything we can do, I hope that we would bring the younger generation to understand this.”\n\n___\n\nJi reported from London.",

            "title": "35 years after China's Tiananmen Square massacre: Why we must never forget",
            "summary": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nThe voices of the brave individuals who perished 35 years ago in the Tiananmen Square massacre continue to echo across our collective conscience.\n\nOn that day, the People’s Liberation Army, acting on the orders of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) leadership, murdered and injured thousands of peaceful pro-democracy protesters calling for political reform and an end to corruption.\n\nThe image of a lone protester using only his body to confront a row of tanks instantly became an enduring global symbol of resistance against oppression.\n\nIt was a day of immense tragedy, described as \"a bloodbath in the center of a world capital.\" The massacre shocked the international community, while also highlighting humanity’s innate desire for liberty.\n\nBIDEN ADMIN SLAMMED AS GRANTING ‘MAJOR COUP’ TO CHINA AFTER TOP OFFICIALS VISIT ON TIANANMEN MASSACRE DATE\n\nHowever, compounding this tragedy is the fact that today, most people under the age of 40 in 21st-century China have little to no understanding of the events that unfolded on June 4, 1989.\n\nAs reported by Radio Free Asia, educators are still forbidden from teaching about it, references to it are instantly removed from China’s heavily censored internet, and even public memorials for the victims are strictly prohibited.\n\nThere is one clear reason why the CCP has tried to wipe this dark chapter in China’s history from its public discourse: fear.\n\nThe shocking loss of innocent life, and the protests leading up to it, embody an unyielding demand for democracy and human rights – values that directly challenge President Xi Jinping's centralized and increasingly oppressive rule. Xi and the rest of the CCP believe that by erasing the memory of Tiananmen, they can stifle dissent and silence calls for freedom – and, to some extent, they have succeeded.\n\nTIANANMEN SQUARE: TAIWAN VIGIL REMEMBERS VICTIMS OF CHINA MASSACRE\n\nThis is precisely why we cannot allow the memory of Tiananmen to fade away. It is why we have come together to amplify the voices demanding democracy for China, ensuring that the courage and sacrifices of those who stood against tyranny are never forgotten.\n\nNearly a decade before that fateful day, the United States began engaging in normalization efforts with Beijing, believing its integration into the global economy would lead to greater civic freedoms for its people. Both Democratic and Republican administrations achieved some success in deepening diplomatic ties and widening people-to-people contacts and exchange programs, and U.S. multinationals reaped significant profits in the China market.\n\nBut, they were wrong. The strategic gamble that economic growth and global integration would lead to improvements in human rights and neighborly relations was a fatal error, one whose victims are the Chinese people themselves.\n\nIn recent years, the Chinese government has only gotten worse. Xi has intensified his control over his people while extending his nation’s authoritarian reach across borders through brazen acts of transnational repression.\n\nTIANANMEN SQUARE MASSACRE MASTERMIND KNOWN AS THE 'BUTCHER OF BEIJING' DIES\n\nHe has helped turn his country into an Orwellian surveillance state with formidable economic and military power, trampling over human rights with impunity, bullying its neighbors, and presenting itself as an alternative to democratic governance.\n\nIn response, the United States has more recently shifted its approach to addressing relations with China to prioritize national security over economic interests. We are diversifying our supply chains, limiting China’s access to technologies and products that could further enhance its economic and military capacity, and strengthening our defense alliances across the Indo-Pacific. While successive recent administrations have taken important action in this regard, it has often been the Congress that has led the way.\n\nAs we’ve learned before, this national security focus, while important, must not crowd out our focus on human rights. We must not overlook the aspirations and dignity of the Chinese people, who continue to strive for greater freedoms and economic opportunities in their own country.\n\nThe concerns of the United States lie squarely with Xi and his government, not the people of China, and we must continue our staunch support for them in their struggle for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Doing so is both a moral obligation and a strategic necessity for building stable international relations and bolstering our national security.\n\nCHINA'S SILENCING OF TIANANMEN TRIBUTES EXTENDS TO HONG KONG\n\nOur commitment to human rights around the world only holds weight when we boldly denounce violations wherever and whenever they occur, and take action. By uniting with a resolute voice at home, and drawing wisdom and strength from the lessons of history, we can pave the way for a more dignified and prosperous future for all people across the globe.\n\nThis unity of purpose should clearly convey our nation’s support for those who have made the ultimate sacrifice fighting for freedom against oppressive regimes, such as that of Xi, and forcefully condemn efforts to censor information, rewrite history, and suppress the truth about mass atrocities and crimes against humanity.\n\nThis is precisely what I aim to achieve by introducing a bipartisan resolution honoring the victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre.\n\nThis legislation represents a united call for justice, not only for the tragic events that transpired 35 years ago, but also for Beijing’s ongoing human rights abuses today, including the brutal repression of Tibetan and Uyghur communities. It highlights the systematic erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong and condemns Xi’s widespread use of transnational repression, which targets Chinese diaspora communities and activists globally.\n\nHONG KONG UNIVERSITY SAYS 'PILLAR OF SHAME' STATUE HONORING TIANANMEN SQUARE DEAD MUST COME DOWN\n\nBy shedding light on these issues, we can underscore the urgent need to hold the People’s Republic of China (PRC) accountable for its human rights abuses and to counter Xi's attempts to undermine international norms and threaten global security.\n\nIn commemorating the Tiananmen Square massacre, we honor the courageous spirit of those who embody what Nobel laureate and human rights activist Liu Xiaobo called \"the enduring human quest for freedom,\" be it in China or anywhere else in the world.\n\nWe see that spirit in the people of Taiwan and their newly elected president, Dr. Lai Ching-te, who share the very same democratic aspirations as the thousands of peaceful Chinese protesters who were killed and injured on that tragic day in 1989.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nWe ask our fellow Americans to join us in paying tribute to the heroes of Tiananmen Square by recognizing the sacrifices they made in pursuit of liberty, dignity, and self-determination.\n\nTogether, through our shared support for democracy and human rights, we can give voice to those silenced by the PRC and ensure that the legacy of Tiananmen continues to inspire generations to come.",

            "title": "China and Hong Kong reportedly detain dissidents before Tiananmen Square anniversary",
            "summary": "Chinese and Hong Kong authorities have arrested or put under surveillance several dissidents before the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre this week, according to human rights groups.\n\nOn 4 June it will be 35 years since Chinese soldiers shut down a weeks-long peaceful protest with violence, killing anything from several hundred to several thousand people.\n\nCommemorative events are planned in cities around the world, including Tokyo, London, Taipei and New York – where a museum dedicated to the massacre was opened last year – but not in the country where it occurred.\n\nThe event has been banned from public acknowledgment in China, prompting those who want to commemorate or discuss it to find creative ways to get around censors to avoid persecution.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said several individuals connected to the 4 June remembrance had been put under surveillance or temporarily moved from their homes by authorities. Among them were Zhan Xianling, a founding member of the Tiananmen Mothers group of victims’ relatives, the human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang, and the Guizhou student leader Ji Feng.\n\nMentions of the anniversary are largely impossible on China’s strictly controlled internet and media. Even obscure references in photos, words and dates are often blocked from social media posts.\n\nFamous photographs, such as that of the “tank man”, are banned, but so too are images or mentions of yellow rubber ducks after the toy became a popular replacement image. In 2022, one of China’s most popular shopping influencers was abruptly taken off air after a cake shaped like a tank was briefly shown on his live stream.\n\nView image in fullscreen A man stands in front of a line of tanks in Tiananmen Square in June 1989. Photograph: Jeff Widener/AP\n\nIn the lead-up to the anniversary, some platforms and institutions appeared to be removing any opportunity for memorial posts. On its Weibo account on Friday, World of Warcraft said its website would be undergoing maintenance from 3-5 June, and users would be unable to log in or leave messages. On Saturday, a secondary school in Shanxi issued a notice to staff telling them not to post on social media until notified, and that assembly and religious activities were banned on 4 June, according to “Teacher Li”, who runs an information-sharing and activism-monitoring account on X.\n\nFor three decades, the largest Tiananmen memorial event was held in Hong Kong, but under a tightening crackdown by the city’s government against the pro-democracy movement, that too has been banned. Attempts to organise candlelit vigils across the city and in homes have resulted in arrests.\n\nLast week, Hong Kong police used a new national security law to arrest seven people, accusing them of publishing messages with seditious intent ahead of an “upcoming sensitive date”.\n\nThe police searched homes and seized electronic devices. “Those who intend to endanger national security should not imagine that they can avoid police pursuit anonymously online,” the police said.\n\nOne of the women arrested was already in prison. Local media identified her as Chow Hang-tung, a prominent barrister and human rights activist who has been jailed on other charges.\n\nChow’s case is the subject of a documentary that will be screened at a 4 June event in Japan on Tuesday. She had been an organiser of Hong Kong’s Tiananmen Vigils, with the since-disbanded Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China. However, in December 2022, she and others were charged with “inciting others to take part in an unauthorised assembly”. Chow was acquitted, but that was then overturned by the court of appeal in January.\n\n“The Chinese government is seeking to erase memory of the Tiananmen massacre throughout China and in Hong Kong,” said Maya Wang, the acting China director at Human Rights Watch. “But 35 years on, the government has been unable to extinguish the flames of remembrance for those risking all to promote respect for democracy and human rights in China.”\n\nThe introduction of two new national security laws since 2020 have driven a climate of fear and self-censorship in Hong Kong, where activists, media, and others say it is not clear where the red lines are for authorities.\n\nIn its most recent issue, Hong Kong’s Christian Times newspaper published mostly blank space on its front page. It also did not publish it online as usual, saying it could not do so because of “circumstances”.\n\nIn an editorial, the paper, which in the past has often published articles about the Tiananmen anniversary, said society had become “restrictive”, and it could only “respond to the current situation by turning paragraphs into blank squares and white space”.\n\n“Even a prayer that originates from historical memories may arouse ‘concern’,” it said.\n\n“Facing history honestly is not to perpetuate grievances, nor to smear and incite, but to give future repentance and reconciliation a solid foundation.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Chi-hui Lin",

            "title": "New York museum ‘keeps memories alive’ 35 years after Tiananmen crackdown",
            "summary": "A bloodied blouse, a tent and a military medal are among the exhibits commemorating China’s brutal suppression of student protests in 1989.\n\nNew York City – When Zhou Fengsuo last saw the mimeograph machine, he was running for his life as the tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square in Beijing in June 1989.\n\nFor weeks before that night of bloodshed, Zhou had used the machine, a state-of-the-art photocopier at the time, to churn out leaflets to spread the message of China’s pro-democracy movement.\n\nAs one of the last student leaders to leave the square, Zhou tried to talk fellow demonstrators out of heaving the 40-pound (18kg) hulk of solid metal. This may come in handy someday, they argued, and hauled it away on bicycles.\n\nMore than three decades later, Zhou was stunned to see that the bulky relic of the rebellion had been secreted out of China for a new museum in New York.\n\nThe June 4th Memorial Museum opened a year ago through concerted efforts by Zhou and a few other veterans of the Tiananmen demonstrations now living in the United States. The urgency for a new museum came after the one in Hong Kong was closed down by the authorities there in 2021.\n\n“We viewed this as the effort to erase the memories,” David Dahai Yu, the museum’s director, told Al Jazeera. “We want people to understand why [Tiananmen] happened and what it means…to tell the story.”\n\nOn June 4, 1989, the Chinese government deployed armed troops to crush mass student-led protests that had occupied Tiananmen Square for weeks. At least hundreds of protesters and bystanders, if not more, are believed to have been killed.\n\nIn the years afterwards, Hong Kong held an annual mass candlelight vigil for all those who perished, without any interference from Chinese authorities who snubbed out even private memorials in mainland China. And finally, in 2014, the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, a coalition initially formed in 1989 to help the mainland protesters, founded the museum.\n\nTimes have changed, however. Since 2020, the only city on Chinese soil where the public was free to mark June 4th is now under two draconian national security laws, which ban the annual vigil with threats of arrest and jail time. The Hong Kong museum was shut down just two days before the 32nd anniversary in 2021 and all the exhibits were confiscated.\n\n‘So much that I never knew’\n\nNot all was lost. Instead, as news of the US museum spread, more artefacts from that heady Beijing spring began to appear.\n\nSoon after Zhou and others spread the word on their new museum in the heart of Manhattan’s shopping district, they started receiving unexpected items: the blood-splattered blouse of a reporter who worked for the People’s Liberation Army newspaper; the leaflets distributed by Zhou; a medal and commemorative watch awarded to “the defenders of the motherland”, as Beijing dubbed the soldiers who suppressed the movement.\n\nThere was even a like-new Nikko tent, one of the hundreds ferried in from Hong Kong and kept as a memento by a pair of protesters who camped in the square as newlyweds.\n\nAnother item bound for the museum was an installation by exiled Chinese artist Chen Weimin, which had been displayed for decades in a California desert.\n\nAn avid collector of all things Tiananmen, Zhou told Al Jazeera: “I learned in the process so much that I never knew before.”\n\nZhou was jailed in China for one year for his involvement in the protests before settling in the US in the early 1990s and founding a humanitarian NGO.\n\nIn recent years, he has been helping Hong Kong protesters who fled surveillance and arrest. He asked some of them to fill a room in the museum with an illustrated timeline of the 2019 antigovernment protests. A construction worker’s helmet and a yellow umbrella used by a protester were donated to the museum.\n\nOne of the 2019 protesters has parlayed his visual art training and renovation skills into designing the exhibit.\n\n“It’s difficult to explain to outsiders why Hong Kong resorted to violent struggles,” said Locky Mak, 25, who landed in New York last year with only a backpack and requested to be known only by a pseudonym for fear of reprisal. “That said, I feel that [the Tiananmen veterans] admire the Hong Kong people and are very supportive of our struggles.”\n\nFor Zhou, the focus of all the remembrances is not just about the tragic end. “It’s also about hope and solidarity: the other possibility for China,” he said.\n\nHowever, splits emerged soon after Wang Dan, one of the most prominent Tiananmen student leaders and one of the museum’s founders, faced a slew of sexual harassment accusations and related civil lawsuits in Taipei, where he sometimes resides and where he co-founded the New School for Democracy in 2011.\n\nWhen a group of mainland Chinese students in New York called out Wang in a public statement, they were banned from hosting events at the museum. Yu said he made the decision after they refused to retract their statement, which he called “one-sided”.\n\nEven into its second year of operations, the all-volunteer-run museum has kept limited hours: opening only two days a week for four hours at a time. Fundraising, which kicked off in 2021 soon after the demise of the Hong Kong museum and buoyed by great enthusiasm, has grown sluggish and remains far short of the $2m initial goal. The $580,000 raised so far is sufficient for two more years of operations, according to Yu.\n\nJiao Ruilin, 31, started volunteering as a museum guide last July 2023, two months after leaving his native Shanghai for freedom in the US. Before, Jiao would learn dribs and drabs about Tiananmen by eavesdropping on whispers among his relatives.\n\n“The exhibits have opened my eyes to the harm of the dictatorship,” Jiao said. “Of course, I want China to change, but I also realise the power of individuals may fall short in affecting change.”\n\nEven so, the Tiananmen veterans are resolved to carry on. Except for a few fake Facebook pages, they said there has been no transnational sabotage from Beijing so far, despite the country’s growing international reach.\n\nAndrew Nathan, a sinologist at New York’s Columbia University who co-edited The Tiananmen Papers, a trove of secret Chinese official documents on the protests and the crackdown, believes the resurrected museum is serving an important role.\n\n“There’s nothing else that keeps the memories alive,” said Nathan.",

It is also seen as propping up the Russian economy by purchasing vast quantities of oil and gas, softening the impact of Western sanctions.\n\nMr Zelensky made a surprise appearance at the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore attended by defence chiefs from around the world, including US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Chinese defence minister Dong Jun.\n\nThe visit was aimed at drumming up support from Asian countries. Besides meeting regional leaders, he also urged delegates to attend his summit due to be held later in June.\n\nMr Zelensky said it would focus on achieving nuclear security, food security, and the release of prisoners of war and Ukrainian children held in Russia.\n\nSo far 106 countries said they would send high-level representatives or their leaders to the summit, he said.\n\nRussia has not been invited and China is not attending.\n\nA formal invitation was not issued to Russia as Moscow had told Switzerland early on that it did not want to participate, the BBC understands.\n\nMr Zelensky claimed that Russia was attempting to disrupt the summit by pressuring countries not to attend, through threats of a blockade of agricultural goods, chemical goods, and energy.\n\nCertain countries were assisting this “diplomatic disruption”, he added.\n\nHe named China later on, and said it was “working for countries to not come to the peace summit”, unlike the US which has promised to send a high-level representative and is encouraging others to attend.\n\nRussia was doing \"everything to disrupt the peace summit\" by using \"Chinese influence on the region\" and diplomats to do so, he said.\n\n\"It is unfortunate that such a big, independent, powerful country as China is an instrument in the hands of Putin.\"\n\nChina's foreign ministry had said that the conference \"should have the recognition of Russia and Ukraine\" and equal participation. \"Otherwise, it is difficult for the conference to play a substantive role in restoring peace,\" a spokeswoman said on Friday.\n\nMr Zelensky also said China's leader Xi Jinping had earlier promised him they would “stand aside in this war and would not support Russia with weapons”.\n\nBut, he added, there are now “elements that are part of Russia’s weaponry” that come from China, according to various intelligence agencies. He called for China to maintain a “consistent” position.\n\nThe US has said that China is helping Russia make more munitions, armoured vehicles and missiles. It estimates about 70% of the machine tools and 90% of the microelectronics Russia imports come from China.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Chinese defence minister Dong Jun said they do not supply weapons to either party of the Ukraine conflict.\n\nHe also said they have put \"strict controls\" on the exports of dual-use technology, which are items that can be used for civilian and military purposes.\n\n\"We have never done anything to fan the flames. We stand firmly on the side of peace and dialogue,\" he said in his speech.\n\nMr Zelensky said he did not meet Mr Dong at the dialogue, but he did meet Mr Austin. The two discussed the US’ decision to let Ukraine use American weapons on Russian territory, according to Mr Zelensky.\n\nThat decision comes with certain restrictions. Asked by the BBC if he requested the removal of limitations, he said he was grateful to the US for allowing Ukraine to use the HIMARS artillery rocket system by the border of the Kharkiv region which has seen intense fighting.\n\n“Is that sufficient? No,” he said, adding that there were airfields from which Russia was permanently firing “knowing that Ukraine will not fire back”.\n\nThe US joins other Western states such as France in allowing Ukraine more leeway in using Western-supplied weapons. Russia has warned of “serious consequences” of this move.\n\nThis weekend marked the second time Mr Zelensky has visited Asia since the war began. He made a surprise appearance at the G7 leaders’ summit a year ago in Hiroshima, Japan.",

            "title": "TikTok: AI fakes, abuse and misinformation pushed to young voters",
            "summary": "TikTok users being fed misleading election news, BBC finds\n\n13 hours ago Marianna Spring , Disinformation reporter and social media correspondent Share\n\nBBC Misinformation about Sir Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak is among the content promoted to young voters' TikTok feeds\n\nYoung voters in key election battlegrounds are being recommended fake AI-generated videos featuring party leaders, misinformation, and clips littered with abusive comments, the BBC has found. With TikTok emerging as a new social media battleground in this election, the political parties have begun a war of memes on the app in a bid to reach its audience of young voters. But a BBC project to investigate the content promoted by social media algorithms has found - alongside funny montages - young people on TikTok are being exposed to misleading and divisive content. It is being shared by everyone from students and political activists to comedians and anonymous bot-like accounts. Videos which have racked up hundreds of thousands of views have promoted unfounded rumours that a major scandal prompted Rishi Sunak to call an early election and the baseless claim that Sir Keir Starmer was responsible for the failure to prosecute serial paedophile Jimmy Savile. Satirical, fake AI-generated clips show Rishi Sunak declaring, “Please don’t vote us out, we would be proper gutted!” and making unevidenced claims about how the Conservative leader is spending public money - including how he will send his “mates loads of dosh”.\n\nWatch: Marianna Spring explains the Undercover Voters project in 60 seconds\n\nOther AI-generated videos share misleading claims about his national service pledge for 18-year-olds, suggesting young people would be sent to current war zones in Ukraine and Gaza. Some of these are described as satire or parody in captions, but the comments suggest some users are confused about which claims are factual. TikTok told the BBC it had increased its investment in countering misinformation for the UK general election, including adding a fact-checking expert to existing resources and employing AI-labelling technology. The videos were spotted as part of the BBC's Undercover Voters project, which has created profiles for 24 fictional people on all the major social media sites, based on data and analysis by the National Centre for Social Research (Natcen).\n\nIn a satirical deepfake, Rishi Sunak appeared to say he would be \"proper gutted\" if he lost - but some users were confused about whether it was real\n\nThe fictional profiles represent a range of voters in battleground constituencies across the UK, giving an insight into what content is promoted to different types of people. The profiles are private, with no friends. They just like, follow and watch content relevant to their character traits informed by the Natcen research. I examined the feeds of the profiles of three of these fictional voters in the former “red wall” constituency of Bishop Auckland, a target for Labour which is currently held by the Conservatives - and where our Undercover Voters are younger. Their social media feeds revealed that, while other sites have also experienced a flurry of political content, TikTok had the most lively conversation, particularly among younger voters. TikTok has boomed since the last election. According to media regulator Ofcom, it was the fastest-growing source of news in the UK for the second year in a row in 2023 - used by 10% of adults in this way. One in 10 teenagers say it is their most important news source. TikTok is engaging a new generation in the democratic process. Whether you use the social media app or not, what is unfolding on its site could shape narratives about the election and its candidates - including in ways that may be unfounded. Content promoted to Undercover Voter character Jack, a disaffected 31-year-old, include TikToks misrepresenting remarks made by Labour politicians in speech bubbles. These include comments about immigration, transgender rights, Brexit - and false claims that the shadow international development secretary called to “abolish the Army”.\n\nA video made reference to the unfounded story that Sir Keir Starmer was involved in the decision not to prosecute serial paedophile Jimmy Savile\n\nSeveral other videos repeated the unfounded allegations about Sir Keir and Jimmy Savile. Other videos Jack was served on his feed included clips with threats in the comments about “euthanizing” Rishi Sunak and racist remarks about him. Messages such as “vote Reform UK” were shared repeatedly in the comments of many videos, much more than those I saw in support of any other party. TikTok users have begun to notice the comments, with many calling the posters “Reform bots”, suggesting they could be fake, automated accounts. I contacted some of the commenters who had photos and names on their profiles, and they told me they were real people based in the UK with no official affiliation to Reform UK and with no encouragement or instruction from the party. But others were anonymous with no profile image and numerical usernames - common hallmarks of fake accounts - and they did not respond to my messages.\n\nRepeated comments supporting Reform UK have prompted the nickname \"Reform bots\"\n\nWhether they are real people or not, their comments can create the impression that their preferred party has greater support. Another Undercover Voter character based in Bishop Auckland, 25-year-old Chloe, was created to have no prior interest in politics. But about one in 10 posts on her TikTok feed was a political meme or funny video, including official content coming from the Labour Party, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Reform UK. These include Rishi Sunak’s first TikTok on the Conservatives’ new account about national service, clarifying that he is not forcing all 18-year-olds to join the army. They also include a video of Cilla Black singing Surprise Surprise from the official Labour profile - with a caption saying “POV: Rishi Sunak turning up on your 18th birthday to send you to war”.\n\nOne post claimed without evidence that the election had been called because a scandal about Rishi Sunak was \"about to erupt\"\n\nA third Undercover Voter named Louise - in her 50s and politically undecided - was pushed more TikToks targeting political leaders with abusive comments, as well as satirical montages and parody videos about policy announcements such as national service. I tracked down some of the people behind the videos and posts shown to our Undercover Voters. One 16-year-old from the south of England, who made a satirical edit of that first Rishi Sunak TikTok about national service, said she was surprised how quickly her content took off. “I didn’t specifically create this account for the election and the reason I made the TikTok initially was just for a joke - I didn’t expect to get over 400k bloody views,” she said, adding that she is not affiliated with any party and has not received any money for creating the TikTok. “Social media really is the only platform for young people to have a voice nowadays in my opinion.” She said she knows satirical content can be “controversial” and she understands how her video “could mislead people” but would hope people could tell it was supposed to be a bit of fun. Alongside the video, some users had posted threatening comments towards Mr Sunak, but the 16-year-old said she did not think anyone would actually want to harm a politician.\n\nThere are 24 Undercover Voters in eight consituencies across the UK. For this story, we looked at three in Bishop Auckland\n\nDozens of other users I messaged who are creating this content are also in their late teens or early 20s, and want to get involved in creating political videos to engage other people their age in the election. They all tell me that while they may support a political party, they have not been paid for their posts and are not officially affiliated with any of the campaigns. One politics student tells me they “don’t worry about misleading people because the parties mislead others with their opinions about other parties”. Another person based in Coventry, who shares his videos about Reform UK, tells me he hopes to “boost their popularity in an unofficial way” and says he set up his account back in February. He say he is a member of the party and has not received any money for making his TikToks. He is concerned that satirical content - including his own - might unintentionally mislead people on TikTok. His account was restricted by TikTok for posting spam. A spokesperson for TikTok told the BBC that it had increased its investment “in efforts to ensure reliable information can be found on TikTok”, launching a “UK Election Centre with a fact-checking expert” and adopting an “industry-leading AI labelling technology”. It also said it was introducing “more policies to aggressively counter foreign election interference” and that it removed 97% of videos with misinformation about elections and civic issues before anyone had viewed them.",

            "title": "Labour is already dominating the online general election campaign",
            "summary": "The video opens with an old clip of Cilla Black singing her classic ‘Surprise, Surprise!’. The caption reads “POV: Rishi Sunak turns up at your 18th birthday to send you to war.”\n\nThis appeared on Labour’s TikTok account the day after the Conservatives launched their national service policy. It fitted perfectly with TikTok’s meme-heavy, wry and sarcastic culture and has been watched 4.5 million times. The video racked up almost 700,000 likes, more than double the likes on all the Tories’ TikToks put together.\n\nThe 2024 general election will be the most online election ever. But as our digital lives get more complex and people’s methods of getting information and interacting with each other diversify, so the campaigns must take their digital footprints farther afield.\n\nOnline campaigning has changed dramatically. There are more platforms, with voter-siloing as a byproduct. Voters discuss politics with friends in private spaces like WhatsApp groups now, rather than public spaces like Facebook walls. There is more money for parties’ digital teams. And online campaigning is now totally ubiquitous. All this has implications for the nature, scale and approach of the parties’ digital operations.\n\nThe election announcement shocked Westminster. But it should not have shocked the PM’s own party. Yet during week one, it was Labour that had a smoother launch, with content hammering away at a single, simpl message – “change” – while the Tories laboured to get their operation going. Labour’s content on social media feels more nimble, more accessible and of higher quality. Sunak’s operation comes across as scrappier and thrown together.\n\nIf this is a TikTok election, then Labour is walking it. But is this a TikTok election? In a word, probably no. So what is happening online? Away from the excitement of X and TikTok, the big battle for voters’ attention is through paid media: targeted Facebook and Instagram posts, ads that show up when a voter googles something. Videos played before football highlights on YouTube. Here, Labour is also out of the gates a lot faster. During Sunak’s Downing Street speech, more than 150 local Labour candidates launched slick, on-message, locally targeted video ads, pumping their message out in key seats before tight election spending limits kicked in a week later. According to numbers from the ‘Who Targets Me’ monitoring website, Labour outspent the Tories by £350k to £50k on Google/YouTube in the first week and by about £500k to about £200k on Facebook. There is a widely held perception that the Conservatives have a huge war-chest to spend online in this campaign. If that’s true, they’re holding it back for later.\n\nDigital campaigning comes down to a few fundamentals: a clear message, the ability to create content that carries the message in a way that delivers the desired response, and the money and methods to get that content in front of the right people. Aside from digital communications to reach voters, parties are trying to use them to mobilise their own activists.\n\nSupporters on Labour’s email list are getting much higher traffic with requests for donations and to join canvassing sessions. I am told Labour raised more than £1m in the first 48 hours of the election. Both parties will use email, social media and video to persuade members and supporters to get active offline, too, knocking on doors and making phone calls to potential supporters.\n\nBut what about voters? How does any of this help everyday people? For all the ills of social media toxicity, the advent of digital campaigning and communication has opened up new spaces and ways for voters to learn about parties and candidates, and to be participants in the election. People want to engage actively online, not just be passively served content.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Election Edition Free daily newsletter Make sense of the UK election campaign with Archie Bland's daily briefing, direct to your inbox at 5pm (BST).

Now they're racing to build them on the fly.\n\nLabour has found success by posting lots of videos, and using rapid reaction memes like this, which has racked up millions of likes.\n\nTikTok TikTok , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

So it just goes to show that the cut-through happens not just with younger voters as well. There's a lot of middle-aged and older demographics increasingly using TikTok to get their news and information, and they use it.\"\n\nThere's also another dynamic. Having seen the trouble that other platforms have gotten into, TikTok has a blanket ban on political advertising.\n\nThe millions of pounds we have already seen poured into Instagram and YouTube don't work here. So organic reach becomes key.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nAnd, behind closed doors, both parties have tools for boosting that reach.\n\nThe Conservatives have been heavily pushing their Share 2 Win app. It makes it very easy for users to share messages from Conservative HQ to various social media platforms. Notably, TikTok is not one of them.\n\nThe more you share on your own social platforms, the more coins you earn, with a chance to jump up the leaderboard.\n\nLabour has a slightly different emphasis. Its Labour digital campaigners group runs on WhatsApp and offers links to national and local graphics and encourages people to send in their own stories and why people may be voting Labour.\n\nThe idea is not simply to share centrally approved content, though. At a recent online seminar over Zoom, on how to master the \"digital door knock\", the main points were to share messages organically and through friends and family groups online, rather than repost videos of politicians.\n\n\"Keep it personal\" was the title of one of the slides, whilst another gave four tips for telling a good story - one of the tips being \"don't be too political\".\n\n\"That sharing from your friends, from your family, can be more persuasive than just kind of saying something that's broadcast from a political party,\" Professor Dommett explains.\n\n\"So this is where organic comes in. It's something that pops up, you know, it's often shared by someone that we know, and therefore it's likely to resonate a little bit more.\"",

            "summary": "Misinformation about Sir Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak is among the content promoted to young voters' TikTok feeds [BBC]\n\nYoung voters in key election battlegrounds are being recommended fake AI-generated videos featuring party leaders, misinformation, and clips littered with abusive comments, the BBC has found.\n\nWith TikTok emerging as a new social media battleground in this election, the political parties have begun a war of memes on the app in a bid to reach its audience of young voters.\n\nBut a BBC project to investigate the content promoted by social media algorithms has found - alongside funny montages - young people on TikTok are being exposed to misleading and divisive content. It is being shared by everyone from students and political activists to comedians and anonymous bot-like accounts.\n\nVideos which have racked up hundreds of thousands of views have promoted unfounded rumours that a major scandal prompted Rishi Sunak to call an early election and the baseless claim that Sir Keir Starmer was responsible for the failure to prosecute serial paedophile Jimmy Savile.\n\nSatirical, fake AI-generated clips show Rishi Sunak declaring, “Please don’t vote us out, we would be proper gutted!” and making unevidenced claims about how the Conservative leader is spending public money - including how he will send his “mates loads of dosh”.\n\nOther AI-generated videos share misleading claims about his national service pledge for 18-year-olds, suggesting young people would be sent to current war zones in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nSome of these are described as satire or parody in captions, but the comments suggest some users are confused about which claims are factual.\n\nTikTok told the BBC it had increased its investment in countering misinformation for the UK general election, including adding a fact-checking expert to existing resources and employing AI-labelling technology.\n\nThe videos were spotted as part of the BBC's Undercover Voters project, which has created profiles for 24 fictional people on all the major social media sites, based on data and analysis by the National Centre for Social Research (Natcen).\n\nIn a satirical deepfake, Rishi Sunak appeared to say he would be \"proper gutted\" if he lost - but some users were confused about whether it was real [BBC]\n\nThe fictional profiles represent a range of voters in battleground constituencies across the UK, giving an insight into what content is promoted to different types of people. The profiles are private, with no friends. They just like, follow and watch content relevant to their character traits informed by the Natcen research.\n\nI examined the feeds of the profiles of three of these fictional voters in the former “red wall” constituency of Bishop Auckland, a target for Labour which is currently held by the Conservatives - and where our Undercover Voters are younger.\n\nTheir social media feeds revealed that, while other sites have also experienced a flurry of political content, TikTok had the most lively conversation, particularly among younger voters.\n\nTikTok has boomed since the last election. According to media regulator Ofcom, it was the fastest-growing source of news in the UK for the second year in a row in 2023 - used by 10% of adults in this way. One in 10 teenagers say it is their most important news source.\n\nTikTok is engaging a new generation in the democratic process. Whether you use the social media app or not, what is unfolding on its site could shape narratives about the election and its candidates - including in ways that may be unfounded.\n\nContent promoted to Undercover Voter character Jack, a disaffected 31-year-old, include TikToks misrepresenting remarks made by Labour politicians in speech bubbles. These include comments about immigration, transgender rights, Brexit - and false claims that the shadow international development secretary called to “abolish the Army”.\n\nA video made reference to the unfounded story that Sir Keir Starmer was involved in the decision not to prosecute serial paedophile Jimmy Savile [BBC]\n\nSeveral other videos repeated the unfounded allegations about Sir Keir and Jimmy Savile.\n\nOther videos Jack was served on his feed included clips with threats in the comments about “euthanizing” Rishi Sunak and racist remarks about him.\n\nMessages such as “vote Reform UK” were shared repeatedly in the comments of many videos, much more than those I saw in support of any other party.

It was the same man who allegedly opened fire on Mitchell.\n\n\n\n“That’s just how he was — trying to save someone that took his life,” Raper-Edwards said.\n\n\n\nHis parents said their son brought so much life to their large, blended family, and he’s a twin.\n\n\n\n“We called him Molly for short instead of Jamal,” Raper-Edwards said. “Molly had a big heart for people. He loved people. He loved life. Molly would help a stranger off the street.”\n\n\n\nHis family is doing their best to look back on the good times.\n\n\n\n“His smile, his joking around and his corny jokes,” said Dennis R. Edwards Sr., Jamal Mitchell’s parent.\n\n\n\nIt brings them some comfort that Officer Mitchell spent his final moments doing what he loved.\n\n\n\n“It makes me a proud mama to know that people have nothing but good things to say about my son. I’m going to miss him,” Raper-Edwards said in tears.\n\nMitchell’s parents live in Florida and they have plans to make their way to Minnesota to bury their son.\n\nThen, their next stop is to Connecticut to spend time with the rest of their family and grieve.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE:\n\nBCA identifies officers who fired weapons at man who shot, killed Officer Jamal Mitchell\n\nMan who shot MPD Officer Mitchell identified\n\nFallen MPD Officer Jamal Mitchell remembered as ‘incredible father,’ ‘hero’ with ‘very bright future’\n\nSouth Minneapolis community shaken after shooting that left officer dead, several others injured\n\nMemorial growing for ‘hero,’ slain Minneapolis officer Jamal Mitchell",

            "summary": "The Minnesota BCA has identified the two Minneapolis officers who were able to stop a gunman who killed a police officer last week during a shooting spree.\n\nOfficer Jamal Mitchell was killed as he tried to help two people he believed to be shooting victims along Blaisdell Avenue on Thursday afternoon. According to the BCA, Mitchell was the first officer on the scene after 911 calls came in for a shooting at an apartment building near Blaisdell and East 22nd Street.\n\nThe BCA says Mitchell reported over the radio that he saw two men injured in the street as he pulled up. Those two people turned out to be the gunman, Mustafa Mohamed, 35, and a bystander who had been shot. Mohamed was sitting next to a car as Officer Mitchell approached him, trying to see if he was injured. Without warning, the BCA says Mustafa pulled a gun and shot Officer Mitchell.\n\nSWAT teams respond after Officer Jamal Mitchell was killed in a shooting along Blaisdell Avenue on Thursday, May 30. (FOX 9)\n\nMuhamed kept firing at Mitchell until two other officers pulled up. Mohamed then took shots at the other officers. Those officers, identified Sunday as Nick Kapinos and Luke Kittock, were able to fire the shots that stopped Mohamed's rampage.\n\nMitchell was rushed to Hennepin County Medical Center where he was pronounced dead. Kittock was also struck by gunfire during the exchange with Mohamed. He was treated and released from the hospital.\n\nThe bystander, who Officer Mitchell was trying to help, was also seriously injured. A firefighter was also hurt during the chaos.\n\nAlong with those outside, police also found a body in the apartment building near the shooting scene on Blaisdell Avenue.\n\nMohamed was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nWho is Jamal Mitchell?\n\nJamal Mitchell had been with the Minneapolis Police Department since 2022, and was sworn in by Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara. In a late-night news conference, O'Hara remembered Mitchell fondly, saying, \"I knew Jamal. I had the distinct honor of swearing in Jamal as a Minneapolis police officer. Shortly after hitting the street, I commended and honored him for running into a burning house in the 5th Precinct to rescue an elderly couple. He loved the job, he loved the MPD, and he was faithful to the oath he swore unto his death.\"\n\nFOX 9 previously reported on Officer Mitchell's heroic actions in 2023 when, just days on the job, he ran into the burning home to rescue the couple.\n\nMitchell, who was 36, was engaged to be married and had a son.\n\n\"Jamal died a hero, and like police officers in Minneapolis standing behind me here and everywhere, he was one of the few who have the courage to stand up and answer the call every single day. He died doing what we asked him to do for the rest of us,\" O'Hara said. \"Jamal died doing what society asks all police officers to do. He did his job, and he was loyal to his oath until his death. There is no more honorable service one can provide.\"\n\nOfficer Mitchell's death marks the first line-of-duty death for Minneapolis police since 2002 when Officer Melissa Schmidt was killed. Officer Schmidt was also killed on Blaisdell Avenue while responding to a report of a woman with a gun at a public housing complex.\n\n",

            "summary": "Washington — Former President Donald Trump has joined TikTok, posting for the first time Saturday on the widely popular video-sharing app controlled by a Chinese parent company that he once tried to ban in the U.S.\n\n\"It's my honor,\" Trump said in the video, which features Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, who declared that \"the president is now on TikTok.\"\n\nThe video, which had garnered more than 2 million likes by Sunday afternoon, features clips from Trump's attendance at the UFC match in Newark, New Jersey, on Saturday, where he was greeted by supporters after being convicted in the New York \"hush money\" trial on all 34 felony counts days earlier.\n\nBy Sunday night, Trump had attracted 3 million TikTok followers, the Reuters news agency reported.\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump attends UFC 302 at Prudential Center on June 01, 2024 in Newark, New Jersey. Luke Hales / Getty Images\n\nWhile in office, Trump took issue with the social media app being controlled by a China-based parent company, trying unsuccessfully to ban the app in the U.S. with an executive order. Earlier this year, a renewed push against the app gained momentum in Congress, as lawmakers approved a foreign aid package that included a provision that required its sale within a year or a ban from U.S. app stores.\n\nBut before Congress approved and President Biden signed the legislation that could lead to a ban on TikTok into law, Trump changed his tune. He argued that banning TikTok would benefit Facebook, which he called the \"true Enemy of the People.\"\n\nTrump's super PAC joined TikTok last month, despite his previous views. At the time, Taylor Budowich, the CEO of MAGA Inc., said in a post on X that \"we will ensure President Trump's America First agenda is brought to every corner of the internet and every precinct of this country.\"\n\nThe development comes months after Mr. Biden's reelection campaign launched its own account on TikTok, despite his administration's support for the legislation that could lead to a ban. For both campaigns, the app presents an opportunity to reach young voters, who will be a key demographic in November's election.",

            "title": "Trump, Who Famously Tried to Ban TikTok, Joins TikTok",
            "summary": "Donald Trump is officially on TikTok, an app he once tried to ban. The former president joined the China-based social media platform on Saturday night, posting a video of himself at an Ultimate Fighting Championship fight in New Jersey.\n\n“The president is now on TikTok,” UFC CEO Dana White said into the camera while standing next to the candidate in the first video shared on Trump’s account.\n\n“It’s my honor,” Trump said. With Kid Rock’s “American Badass” playing in the background, clips in the video show Trump in the UFC arena waving to fans as they cheered. Then, Trump said, “That was a good walk on, right?”\n\nBy noon on Sunday, the video had already reached more than 33 million views, and Trump gained just shy of two million followers. According to Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung, the campaign will leave “no front undefended and this represents the continued outreach to a younger audience consuming pro-Trump and anti-Biden content,” he said in a statement.\n\nWhile he may be embracing TikTok now, as president, Trump signed an executive order in 2020 that said “the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned” by Chinese companies presented a threat to national security. TikTok sued and successfully blocked the order.\n\nIn April, Congress passed a bill Biden later signed that could effectively bar the app in the U.S. unless its owner, ByteDance, sells TikTok to an American company. The bill came to fruition out of fears that ByteDance may be trying to influence U.S. elections and could expose Americans’ data to China’s government. TikTok has filed suit to combat the legislation, claiming it violates the First Amendment.\n\n“Congress has taken the unprecedented step of expressly singling out and banning TikTok: a vibrant online forum for protected speech and expression used by 170 million Americans to create, share, and view videos over the Internet,” the company wrote in the suit.\n\nThe federal government, including the F.B.I. and the Federal Communications Commission, has cautioned that Americans’ data held by ByteDance — including browsing habits, location history, and biometric information — could be shared with the Chinese government. TikTok has said it would not allow this to happen. Editor’s picks\n\nEven as recently as this past March, Trump has said that he believes TikTok presents a risk to national security. But, he has changed his mind about banning the app, saying it would only help Facebook, which he blames in part for his 2020 election loss.\n\n“Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it. There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,” Trump said on CNBC’s Squawk Box. “There’s a lot of good and there’s a lot of bad with TikTok. But the thing I don’t like is that without TikTok you’re going to make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media.” Trending Trump Denies Ever Saying 'Lock Her Up.'

But the campaign has only 336,000 followers — far short of Trump’s personal account earning nearly two million and growing. Unlike Trump, Biden does not have a personal account on TikTok.\n\nThis article has been updated.",

The order was later blocked in court.\n\nIn a drastic shift, Trump opposed the latest efforts to ban TikTok this year, claiming it would benefit Facebook, which banned him in January 2021 in the wake of the Capitol riots. He placed the blame on President Biden as legislation to potentially ban the app made its way through Congress and to the president’s desk amid growing national security concerns over the app’s ties to China.\n\nThe bill was quickly signed by Biden in late April, establishing a timeline for ByteDance to sell the app or face a ban from U.S. app stores and networks.\n\nTrump’s super PAC, MAGA Inc., joined TikTok last month under the handle @MAGA. It has more than 17,000 followers and has amassed more than 176,000 likes since its launch, as of Sunday.\n\n“MAGA INC will not cede any platform to Joe Biden and the Democrats who are trying to destroy our country,” Taylor Budowich, CEO of MAGA Inc., said last month of the super PAC’s TikTok launch. “We will ensure President Trump’s America First agenda is brought to every corner of the internet and every precinct of this country.”\n\nThe move to join the platform could signal an attempt to engage with younger voters ahead of November as Trump and Biden remain neck and neck in national polling.\n\n“We will leave no front undefended and this represents the continued outreach to a younger audience consuming pro-Trump and anti-Biden content. There’s no place better than a UFC event to launch President Trump’s Tik Tok, where he received a hero’s welcome and thousands of fans cheered him on,” Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement to The Hill.\n\n“The video he posted went immediately viral garnering 40 million views in just a few hours as he has gained 2.5 million followers since the launch,” Cheung added.\n\nEven in the wake of mounting legal battles, Trump has maintained a razor-thin lead of 1.5 points over Biden nationally, according to a polling index by The Hill and Decision Desk HQ.\n\nThe social media launch comes just days after Trump was convicted on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in New York, becoming the first former U.S. president to become a convicted felon.\n\nThe charges were related to reimbursements made to Trump’s former fixer and attorney, Michael Cohen, for a hush money payment he made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels.\n\nHe is slated to be sentenced on July 11, four days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wis. Trump’s legal team has vowed to appeal the case, though proceedings will move forward as scheduled in the meantime.\n\nUpdated at 4:27 pm.",

The situation came to light very suddenly. Despite swift action, we were unable to bridge the necessary gaps,\" read the letter.\n\nEv Dowling, who would be a senior, says he, along with other students, faculty, and staff, are shocked to learn the news.\n\n\"I feel like I'm at the end of that stretch. Three years in, I was making plans for after graduation and now I need to make plans to graduate from somewhere else,\" said Dowling.\n\nThe university's website states there were about 1,300 students and 77 full-time faculty members in 2022.\n\n\"The staff and faculty have worked so hard. They really have given us all the best opportunities, and knowing that they're out of jobs while I'm out of school, it's the worst news ever,\" added Dowling.\n\nUpcoming summer courses will be canceled and the university will not enroll a new class in the fall.\n\nStudents told Action News that they feel the abrupt closure is overwhelming.\n\n\"They just put up these new banners, literally like a month ago. Why?\" questioned Kaylee Morris, a student at UArts.\n\nShe says she was blindsided by Friday's announcement.\n\n\"I had an internship lined up over the summer, I was going into my senior year, I was about to start working on my senior thesis, and I'm just shocked this is happening. There really weren't any signs,\" Morris said.\n\nStaff were just as shocked as the students when receiving the news.\n\n\"I'm an alum and a staff member, so it sucks to lose my job. It also sucks to lose a magical community. One of the few art institutions left in the country,\" said a staff member who did not want to be identified.\n\nHe told Action News that he learned hours before the loss of the accreditation by the staff union group, but he wasn't led to believe the school would close.\n\n\"We had a huge recruitment push for fall of this year,\" he said.\n\nThe university says it will be helping current students by developing \"seamless transfer pathways\" to other Philadelphia schools, including Temple University, Drexel University, and Moore College of Art and Design.\n\nFor some students, however, this plan seems complicated.\n\n\"I'm a theater student. I can go to Temple's musical theater program but my roommate, she's an illustration major, and Temple and Drexel don't have her majors,\" noted UArts student Fern Morehouse.\n\n\"My major is film and animation, that doesn't really exist at other schools. That was part of the reason why I liked this school,\" added Morris.\n\nOn June 3, there will be a town hall for students, faculty, and staff. The university says it will send times and details over the weekend.\n\n\"I'm saddened by the news of University of the Arts' imminent plans to close,\" said Mayor Cherelle L. Parker in a statement sent to Action News.\n\n\"I've spoken with President Walk and with the University's board leadership. I will continue to convene conversations between university leaders and city, state, federal offices, and other stakeholders in the days ahead to determine what can be done to protect every student, faculty and staff member at University of the Arts, a crown jewel in our city's academic and cultural communities. Our City cares deeply about the future of every person who studies or works there,\" Parker continued.\n\nYou can read the full letter below from President Kerry Walk and Chair of the Board of Trustees Judson Aaron:\n\n\"Today is a heartbreaking day.\n\nUniversity of the Arts will close as of Friday June 7, 2024. We would have shared this news with you directly, but the Middle States Commission on Higher Education elected to withdraw UArts' accreditation and announce before we could communicate with you. We know that this makes hearing the news of UArts' abrupt closure even worse.\n\nThe closure means that we will be canceling our summer courses, we will not enroll a new class in the fall, and we will support our continuing students in their progress to degree by developing seamless transfer pathways to our partners: Temple University,\n\nDrexel University, and Moore College of Art and Design, among others.\n\nWe know that the news of UArts' closure comes as a shock. Like you, we are struggling to make sense of the present moment. But like many institutions of higher learning, UArts has been in a fragile financial state, with many years of declining enrollments, declining revenues, and increasing expenses. We have worked hard this year alongside many of you to take steps that would secure the University's sustainability. The progress we made together has been impressive.\n\nUnfortunately, however, we could not overcome the ultimate challenge we faced: with a cash position that has steadily weakened, we could not cover significant, unanticipated expenses. The situation came to light very suddenly. Despite swift action, we were unable to bridge the necessary gaps.\n\nOn Monday, June 3, 2024 we will host separate town hall meetings for students, faculty, and staff; we will send times and details for those town halls over the coming weekend. We are committed to providing a space for your questions and concerns.\n\nWe have done everything in our power to address this crisis and avoid the worst possible outcome: an abrupt closure.

It also requested a teach-out plan by June 7, 2024, that would give students a fair chance to finish their education.\n\nUArts lost its accreditation because of what was submitted in the supplemental information report, according to MSCHE.\n\n“University of the Arts is deeply saddened to announce it will be closing as of Friday, June 7, 2024.

This esteemed arts school has been a cornerstone of creativity and culture in Center City Philadelphia for generations. Its loss is a significant setback and not only a devastating blow to our local community but also a significant setback for the arts and education in our city at large,\" Pennsylvania State Representative Ben Waxman said in a statement.\n\nOfficials with the university say they will be hosting town hall meetings for the school community.

It's an institution that has been a fixture in Philadelphia producing artists and musicians from around the world.\n\n\"I’ve learned so much from my time there.

As of Saturday, they hadn’t yet received details on a town hall the university said it will hold for students and faculty on Monday — but Roberts plans to be there.\n\n“UArts’ whole brand to their students, it’s like ‘Building community through art.’ And in the last 24 hours, they said that doesn’t matter with their actions,” Roberts said.\n\nThe closure was first made public when the Middle States Commission on Higher Education announced the immediate withdrawal of accreditation effective Saturday. UArts notified the commission on Wednesday about the school’s impending closure. The commission said UArts failed to provide adequate plans for closure.\n\nThe UArts teachers union told WHYY News Friday night that they had not been notified of the closure prior to the commission’s announcement.\n\nThe university said the reason for the sudden closure was due to financial issues:\n\n“We know that the news of UArts’ closure comes as a shock.

The recent Bucks County Community College graduate said as of Saturday morning she still had not received any direct communication from the university about the pending closure.\n\n“I’m a little frustrated, because now I have to figure something out for school,” she said. “I don’t know what I’m going to do now because all of the applications for other colleges have closed by now.”\n\nCressman said “sooner would have been better” to know about the closure. She was in contact with her adviser recently about her classes and the closure announcement came “right out of the blue.”\n\n“There’s not a lot of art schools in Philly so it’s sad seeing them close,” Cressman said.\n\nUniversity of the Arts now joins Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts as another higher education arts institution that has shuttered its degree programs. PAFA announced in January it was cutting its degree programs at the conclusion of the 2024-2025 academic year due to declining enrollment and increasing costs. The Delaware College of Art and Design, in Wilmington, Del., also announced in May it was closing this year, and would not be open for the 2024-2025 academic year.\n\n“It just feels like one more nail in the coffin in Philadelphia,” Fried, the UArts professor, said, noting that the university was supposed to absorb some of the PAFA students who are going to be left without a program next year.\n\nConrad Benner, a Philly-based arts curator and founder of StreetsDept.com, started a discussion on X, asking people to talk about whether or not they stayed in Philadelphia because of University of the Arts or PAFA programs.",

            "summary": "Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and others see an opportunity, but it remains unclear who will be qualified to run by the Guardian Council.\n\nTehran, Iran – Iran’s ex-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and other divisive figures – such as moderate Ali Larijani and ultraconservative Saeed Jalili – have signed up to contest new elections after the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nAhmadinejad, who was president from 2005 to 2013, registered along with dozens of others at the interior ministry on Sunday, a day before the sign-up period ends.\n\nThe politician, who had been largely sidelined following his controversial terms in office, said he’s only heeding “a call from people from across the country” to run again, and he’s confident he can resolve Iran’s domestic and international issues.\n\n“Don’t ask political questions,” he said with a grin when asked by reporters about his reaction if he were to be disqualified from running by the Guardian Council – the constitutional body that vets all candidates.\n\nDespite Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urging him to stay away in 2017, he signed up and was barred from running, but chose to not register for the 2021 election.\n\nAhmadinejad’s presidency was marked by economic malaise defined by massive inflation and currency devaluation, along with explosive tensions over Iran’s nuclear programme – which saw multilateral sanctions imposed on the country.\n\nHis 2009 re-election sparked the Green Movement of protests across the country amid claims of vote tampering, which were refuted by authorities as they mounted a crackdown.\n\nWho else wants to be in the race?\n\nThe dozens who signed up to run for president also include senior security official and former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, former three-time parliament speaker Ali Larijani, Tehran’s Mayor Alireza Zakani, and former central bank chief Abdolnasser Hemmati.\n\nJalili is now the Iranian supreme leader’s representative to the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) and used to be security chief from 2007 to 2013 at the height of the tensions surrounding the nuclear file. He has run for president unsuccessfully three times before.\n\nLarijani, a conservative figure belonging to a powerful family, is perhaps the only relatively moderate candidate with any chance of garnering a considerable number of votes – that is if he is greenlit by the Guardian Council after being disqualified in 2021.\n\nDespite the disqualification last time, Larijani was the first major figure to announce his candidacy, signing up in Tehran on Friday with his campaign releasing a dramatic video containing cinematic shots of him in the process.\n\nAfter the latest presidential and parliamentary elections produced the lowest turnouts in the near 45-year history of the Republic of Iran, turnout is expected to prove a challenging issue during this vote as well.\n\nThe research centre of the Iranian parliament announced on Sunday that 53.4 percent of people – responding to a survey it conducted – said they would vote in the June 28 presidential election, with 28.9 percent still on the fence.\n\nThis is just above the 48 percent that saw Raisi become president, and much higher than the 42 percent turnout announced for the parliamentary election in March.\n\nThe Guardian Council is scheduled to begin vetting the candidates from Tuesday for six days, after which the list of approved candidates will be announced on June 11.",

He and other serious contenders against Raisi had been barred from running in the 2021 election.\n\nLarijani, 66, is viewed as a conservative within Iran’s narrow political scene. However, he has increasingly allied himself with former President Hassan Rouhani, whose administration reached a 2015 nuclear deal with a group of world powers. Larijani had positioned himself as a pragmatic candidate in the 2021 vote in which hard-liner Raisi, a protégé of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was elected.\n\nLarijani had posted online and made comments in recent days all but confirming he would be a candidate. The Larijani family has long been powerful in Iran’s Shiite theocracy.\n\n“Solving the issue of sanctions for an economic opening will be among the priorities of diplomacy” for Iran, Larijani told journalists.\n\nLater Friday, former Iranian Central Bank chief Abdolnasser Hemmati, who also ran in the 2021 presidential election, registered. Hemmati, 67, told journalists: “Today, I still hope for the future.”\n\n“Nothing is more important than the livelihood and welfare of the noble people of Iran,” he added.\n\nAll candidates must be approved by Iran’s 12-member Guardian Council, a panel of clerics and jurists ultimately overseen by Khamenei. That panel has never accepted a woman or anyone calling for radical change within the country’s governance.\n\nWho all will run — and potentially be accepted — remains in question. The country’s acting president, Mohammad Mokhber, a previously behind-the-scenes bureaucrat, could be a front runner because he has already been seen meeting with Khamenei. Also discussed as possible aspirants are former hard-line President Mohammad Ahmadinejad and former reformist President Mohammad Khatami, but whether they would be allowed to run is another question.\n\nThe five-day registration period will close on Tuesday. The Guardian Council is then expected to issue its final list of candidates within 10 days. That will allow for a shortened two-week campaign before the vote in late June.\n\nThe new president will take office while the country is enriching uranium at nearly weapons-grade levels and is hampering international inspections. Iran has armed Russia in its war on Ukraine and launched a drone and missile attack on Israel during the war in Gaza. It also has continued arming proxy groups in the Middle East such as Yemen’s Houthi rebels and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militia.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran’s economy has faced years of hardship over its collapsing rial currency. Widespread protests have swept the country, most recently over the death of Mahsa Amini, who died in police custody in September 2022 after being detained for allegedly violating Iran’s mandatory headscarf law. A U.N. panel said the Iranian government is responsible for the “physical violence” that led to Amini’s death.",

            "title": "80th anniversary of D-Day: This year will likely be the last major D-Day anniversary with living veterans, so organizers are all-out",
            "summary": "Editor’s Note: As the 80th anniversary of D-Day nears, the global fight for democracy continues. CNN Anchor and Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper speaks with World War II veterans and military generals about the worldwide erosion of democratic institutions. “D-Day: Why We Still Fight for Democracy” premieres Sunday, June 2 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on CNN.\n\nCaen, France CNN —\n\nAt 99 years old, Jack Foy is considered the youngster among his group of friends that fought in World War II.\n\nBut their advanced age isn’t going to stop them from making the transatlantic journey to honor their fallen comrades on the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\n\nOn June 6, Foy – a survivor of the Battle of the Bulge – and his fellow American veterans will join dignitaries and heads of state from around the world to commemorate the approximately 160,000 Allied troops who, eight decades ago, carried out the largest seaborne invasion in human history.\n\nFoy told CNN that he has been to several memorials in France since 2014. The emotional resonance of each trip grows stronger year after year, he said, because these veterans know each trip could be their last.\n\n“We realize we’re getting to the end of our time,” Foy said.\n\nThey are not alone.\n\nWith major commemorations held every five years, organizers and government officials concede that this year’s event could be the last to involve living veterans, whose stories of the horrors of war have become particularly poignant given that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought a large-scale ground war back to Europe for the first time since 1945.\n\n“We are perfectly aware that for these centenarians, this is maybe the last chance to return to the beaches where they landed, where they fought and where their brothers-in-arms fell,” said Gen. Michel Delion, the CEO of the French government agency in charge of the French commemoration efforts, Mission Liberation.\n\nWorld War II veteran Jack Foy shakes the hand of the then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley, at last year's D-Day anniversary. 1st Lt. Katherine Sibilla\n\nThe various countries putting together the event are now planning what is expected to be the most extensive D-Day commemoration in history – both in terms of size and, crucially for elderly veterans, logistics.\n\nApproximately 150 American veterans are expected to travel to Normandy – about two dozen of whom actually fought on D-Day – said Charles Djou, the secretary of the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC), the independent agency responsible for managing US military cemeteries and monuments overseas. The youngest is 96.\n\nFifteen Canadian veterans, including three or four that fought on D-Day, are traveling with the Canadian delegation, according to John Desrosiers, the director of international operations for Veterans Affairs Canada. Desrosiers said the youngest traveling with the group is 98 and the eldest are 104.\n\nThe British defense ministry said it expects more than 40 WWII veterans at the various events in Normandy.\n\nUS D-Day veterans attend an event at the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial as part of the 79th anniversary D-Day celebrations on June 6, 2023. Christopher Furlong/Getty Images\n\nThose vets will be joined by about 25 heads of state and government, including US President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Russian President Vladimir Putin was not extended an invitation due to the war in Ukraine, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is planning on attending, according to a French presidential source.\n\nWith so many heads of state in town, the security measures in place are intense. A massive contingent of 12,000 security personnel will be deployed on June 6, the French Interior Ministry said.\n\nHeavy travel restrictions put in place by French authorities will also effectively cut off the Norman coastline and the normally sleepy towns that dot it from the rest of the country.\n\nYet June 6 typically sees these elderly men criss-cross the region to hit a full day’s itinerary, including national ceremonies held at the American, British and Canadian cemeteries; the big international commemoration put on by France; and then, if they have the energy, more local events.\n\nMost veterans also travel with an entire phalanx of medical personnel. The charity that organized Foy’s trip, the US-based Best Defense Foundation, is bringing three doctors and 10 nurses to accompany the 50 veterans they are flying over from the United States. Each veteran will travel with a personal caregiver – typically a family member or a friend.\n\nOfficials say they are going to incredible lengths to treat veterans like royalty – as they are feted by actual royals. King Charles III will be there on June 6 – his first overseas trip since being diagnosed with cancer – alongside Queen Camilla and Prince William, Buckingham Palace said. Representatives from the royal families of Belgium, Monaco, the Netherlands and Norway are also expected to attend.\n\nDelion’s team has been holding rehearsals and timing wheelchair runs for the French-led international ceremony. They are also considering having veterans enter at the same time as heads of states and other dignitaries to reduce their waiting time.\n\nAmerican and Canadian organizers told CNN that they will seat veterans last at their respective national ceremonies to keep them comfortable. The general public at the American event, for example, may need to be seated about an hour in advance due to security precautions.\n\n“We take care of the veterans who served and made the enormous sacrifices that they did in the Second World War,” said Djou.\n\nBritish D-Day veteran Tom Schaffer (left), and companion John Pinkerton study the names on the British Normandy Memorial at Ver-sur-Mer in France ahead of the 79th anniversary of the D-Day landings in June 2023.

Gareth Fuller/PA\n\nKeeping the stories alive\n\nAfter being postponed 24 hours due to bad weather, D-Day began shortly after midnight on June 6, 1944, when paratroopers dropped into German-occupied France to lay the groundwork for the incoming invasion. Allied planes and warships began their bombardment at about 6:30 a.m., with troops hitting the beaches shortly after. They landed on a stretch of coastline 50 miles long organized into five beaches codenamed Gold, Juno, Omaha, Sword and Utah. The Americans were responsible for Omaha and Utah. The British led the assault on Gold and Sword, while the Canadians handled Juno.\n\nThough 4,414 Allied troops died that day and it would take more than a month to achieve one of D-Day’s main objectives – liberating the strategically important city of Caen – the landings were considered a success. Allied troops had successfully made it onshore in France; it was the beginning of the end for Hitler and Nazi Germany.\n\nAmerican troops march up from Omaha Beach on June 18, 1944. Underwood Archives/Getty Images\n\nThe sheer drama of the event has, for decades, captured the American public imagination, because of both the magnitude of the invasion and the fact that it was a “digestible” turning point in the war, according to Ben Brands, a military historian at the ABMC.\n\n“World War II, especially in Europe, becomes this ongoing battle from basically the moment troops land on the beaches of D-Day until Germany ultimately surrenders. The human mind needs to cut that up into digestible stories, and D-Day is a really powerful, discrete event that is so critical for everything that comes after,” Brands said. “There’s just so many powerful stories that come out of D-Day.”\n\nUS military personnel place US and French flags next to the graves of fallen soldiers at the Normandy American Cemetery on June 5, 2023 in Colleville-sur-Mer, France. Christopher Furlong/Getty Images\n\nAs time has passed, veterans have played a crucial role in passing down the stories of D-Day. Their gripping, visceral first-hand accounts are better teachers of history than any textbook.\n\nBut just a fraction of the soldiers who lived through D-Day are still alive.\n\nOf the 16.4 million Americans who served in the military during WWII, fewer than 100,000 are expected to still be alive by the end of the year, according to statistics from the US Department of Veterans Affairs. In Canada, there were just 9,297 living Canadian veterans who had served in either WWII or the Korean War as of March 31, 2023, according to the most recent statistics available from Veterans Affairs Canada. The British defense ministry said it does not keep veteran numbers on hand.\n\nIt’s unclear what the average age of a WWII veteran is. Given that the median age for an American WWII veteran in June 2020 was 93, according to US Census figures at the time, most surviving vets from Allied forces are likely to now be at least in their late-nineties. By the 85th anniversary in 2029, those who are still living will almost certainly be in triple digits.\n\n“People are realizing this generation is passing and they’re passing rapidly now, and it’s important to keep their stories alive, to keep the memories of those who died and are buried at Normandy, but also those who fought and survived because they can no longer be with us for that much longer to tell these stories,” Brands said.\n\n“The 80th will be a very powerful event.”",

            "summary": "ATLANTA (AP) — Hilbert Margol says he didn’t look on himself as a hero when his U.S. Army artillery unit fought its way across Europe during World War II. But he will be feted in France as one of 60 American veterans of that conflict traveling to Normandy to mark the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\n“I know my brother and I never looked at it as we were any kind of heroes, nothing like that,” Margol said recently of himself and his twin brother Howard, who served with him. “It was just our time. That we were asked to serve. And we did.”\n\nThe 100-year-old Margol, who lives in suburban Atlanta, is among the dwindling band of veterans of the conflict leaving Atlanta on Sunday on a chartered flight for Deauville, Normandy. The veterans will take part in parades, school visits and ceremonies — including the official June 6 commemoration of the landings by soldiers from across the United States, Britain, Canada and other Allied nations on five beaches.\n\nMargol didn’t land at D-Day, but the Jacksonville, Florida, native was among those who liberated the Dachau Concentration Camp on April 29, 1945.\n\nThe trip also includes high school and college students selected to escort the veterans and learn about their experiences. Charter flights also took veterans from Atlanta to France in 2022 and 2023.\n\nOn Sunday, the group of 60 veterans, donning customized jackets commemorating the anniversary, arrived at the Atlanta airport to the clapping and cheering from the flight crew and the Dutchtown High School marching band from Hampton, Georgia. The veterans were then guided through the airport to their terminal in a parade headed by the marching band.\n\nWorld War II veteran Jake Larson, a 101-year-old American best known on social media under the name “Papa Jake,” said he joined the national guard when he was 15 for the money and landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day. Reflecting back on the three years he was in Europe, Larson said he is “no hero.”\n\n“I’m just a survivor, but I’m here to honor those people who gave their life so I can be here,” Larson said Sunday before the flight.\n\nHe also had a message to world leaders: \"“Make peace not war.”\n\nAndy Negra of Helen, Georgia came ashore with the 6th Armored Division at Utah Beach on July 18, 1944, about six weeks after D-Day. It is his second trip back to France after also taking part in last year’s flight.\n\n“Well to me, we fought for freedom, and we fought for peace, and we fought for a good life,” Negra, a native of Avella, Pennsylvania, said in a recent interview.\n\nThe trip is being organized by Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, the Best Defense Foundation and the North American branch of French tire maker Michelin.\n\n“It is our privilege to celebrate and honor these heroes by flying them directly to Normandy and recognizing their incredible sacrifices and contributions to the world,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement.",

            "title": "Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi concedes defeat in surprise primary upset by Jenniffer González",
            "summary": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Puerto Rico congressional representative Jenniffer González defeated Gov. Pedro Pierluisi in a surprise upset during a primary election held Sunday by their pro-statehood party.\n\nThe two ran on the same ticket four years ago under the New Progressive Party, but González, a Republican, announced her plan to challenge Pierluisi, a Democrat, in early December. Public jabs between the two turned acrimonious.\n\n“What happened is very painful, and I didn’t expect it, but let no one think that I’m going to slow down in the remainder of this four-year period,” Pierluisi said late Sunday as he congratulated González.\n\nHe addressed his supporters briefly as González celebrated with hers while results continued to trickle in.\n\nGonzález obtained 56% of the vote compared with Pierluisi’s 44%, with an estimated tens of thousands of votes still uncounted. She is the first female gubernatorial candidate to secure a primary win for the New Progressive Party since Sila María Calderón, who became Puerto Rico’s first female governor in 2000.\n\n“Positions do not belong to politicians ... they belong to the people,” González said during a speech shortly after Pierluisi conceded. “I commit to being on the streets, to listen to people.”\n\nRunning with González for the position of resident commissioner is senior U.S. naval military officer Elmer Román, a former secretary of state for Puerto Rico, while Puerto Rico Sen. William Villafañe is seeking the position under Pierluisi.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Puerto Rico Rep. Jesús Manuel Ortiz defeated Sen. Juan Zaragoza in the primary held by their Popular Democratic Party, which backs the island’s territorial status and seeks a return to power in the upcoming general elections.\n\nZaragoza conceded defeat after obtaining 38% of the votes compared with Zaragoza’s 62%, even though only a little more than 60% of the votes had been counted.\n\nAttorney Pablo José Hernández ran unopposed to be the Popular Democratic Party’s candidate for resident commissioner, the first person in 20 years to seek that nomination.\n\nAs results came in late Sunday, the page of Puerto Rico’s elections commission crashed, frustrating many who were closely following the primaries. Officials said they were rushing to fix the problem, saying they did not know what caused it but that U.S. Homeland Security and other agencies were helping.\n\n“If it were necessary to activate the FBI given the situation, we will do it,” said Jessika Padilla, the commission’s alternate president.\n\nOrtiz, González and other candidates face disgruntled voters on an island still struggling with chronic power outages and awaiting completion of reconstruction projects following Hurricane Maria, which hit as a Category 4 storm in September 2017.\n\nPower outages were reported at more than a dozen voting centers, including one where Ortiz arrived to cast his vote, forcing officials to revert to a manual process. Heavy rains also pelted parts of the island, with flood warnings issued for nearly a dozen towns and cities where landslides also were reported.\n\nPower outages were such a big concern that Puerto Rico’s elections commission rented more than a dozen generators and a private power company identified 81 alternate voting sites with guaranteed electricity.\n\n“It’s been years since I last voted,” said Benito López, a 66-year-old retiree wearing a T-shirt that read, “The Island of Enchantment.” He planned to cast a vote for a candidate he would not reveal “to see if there’s any improvement and change.”\n\nOther voter complaints include the difficulty of obtaining business permits, a fractured education system, and the island’s lack of access to capital markets after the local government emerged two years ago from the largest debt restructuring in U.S. history.\n\nMeanwhile, more than $9 billion of debt owed by Puerto Rico’s power company, the largest of any government agency, remains unresolved. A federal judge overseeing a bankruptcy-like process has yet to rule on a restructuring plan following bitter negotiations between the government and bondholders.\n\n“They have broken Puerto Rico,” Cecilio Rodríguez, said of the current and previous administrations as he waited to cast his vote. “Economic development must be a priority.”\n\nFor other voters, stopping the exodus of doctors from Puerto Rico and improving the U.S. territory’s crumbling health system is a priority.\n\n“The patients are the ones who have to stay here and endure this. It’s not fair,” said Dr. Alfredo Rivera Freytes, an anesthesiologist who left Puerto Rico for St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands because of the problems with Puerto Rico’s health system.\n\nHe returned two years ago with plans to retire, but found himself working again because of the need for anesthesiologists in Puerto Rico.\n\nAhead of the primaries, Pierluisi had touted record tourist numbers, hurricane reconstruction and growing economic development among his successes. He had pledged to prioritize projects targeting children and the island’s growing elderly population, among other things.\n\nAn event marking the end of his campaign held a week before the primaries was headlined by former Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, who resigned in August 2019 following nearly two weeks of street touched off by a leak of crude and insulting chat messages between him and his top advisers.\n\nPierluisi’s opponent, González, did not hold a campaign closer. She has pledged to crack down on corruption, award more funds to agencies to help victims of violence amid a surge in killings of women, and stem an exodus of doctors and other medical workers to the U.S. mainland.\n\nGonzález appealed to voters’ frustration earlier Sunday before winning, saying she would work to resolve their problems.\n\n“That’s one of the reasons why I’m aspiring to governorship, because I believe that we should not get used to not having electricity, we should not get used to not having water,” she said.\n\nZaragoza had promised to prioritize climate change and renewable energy, decentralize the island’s education department and improve access to health. His opponent, Ortiz, pledged to improve the licensing process to retain doctors, simplify the island’s tax system and revamp health care.\n\nGonzález and Ortiz will face gubernational candidates from other parties in November’s general elections. Puerto Rico’s next governor will have to work alongside a federal control board that oversees the island’s finances and was created after the government declared bankruptcy.\n\nAhead of Sunday’s primaries, more than 4,900 inmates voted in prisons across the U.S. territory. The State Commission of Elections also received and counted tens of thousands of early ballots.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

            "title": "AMD's new Ryzen AI 300 APU looks super exciting for handheld gaming but what about the battery life?",
            "summary": "Of the two big announcements AMD made today, it could be the new Ryzen AI 300 series APUs that's most exciting. Not only does it come with the same new Zen 5 CPU cores as the other major newness from AMD, the Ryzen 9000 series desktop CPUs. It's got a majorly upgraded integrated GPU that should boost performance substantially.\n\nSome key questions immediately follow. Will Ryzen AI 300, formerly known as the Strix Point APU, appear in handhelds? And if it does will it get the top-spec chip and what are the implications for battery life?\n\nThe fastest of the new AMD Strix Point APUs at launch is the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. It ups the graphics compute unit or CU count from 12 in AMD's previous-gen APUs, such as the Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip found in the OneXPlayer OneXFly, to 16. The new GPU also gets a small clock speed bump from 2.7 GHz to 2.9 GHz.\n\nThose two elements alone would imply a gaming performance bump of about 35%. However, Strix Point's new iGPU is also upgraded to RDNA 3.5 spec from plain old RDNA.\n\nDespite AMD saying the first devices with Ryzen AI 300 will go on sale in July, very few details on RDNA 3.5 have been released. However, the rumours point to an architecture that's largely carried over from RDNA 3 save for one key detail. RDNA 3.5 supposedly gets a fairly major upgrade in ray-tracing performance.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally AMD Ryzen 9 AI 300 Series Header Cell - Column 0 AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 Cores 4 Zen 5, 8 Zen 5C 4 Zen 5, 6 Zen 5C Maximum boost clock 5.1 GHz 5 GHz Total L2+L3 cache 36MB 34MB GPU Radeon 890M Radeon 880M GPU spec 16 RDNA 3.5 CUs 12 RDNA 3.5 CUs NPU 50 TOPS 50 TOPS\n\nArguably, ray tracing is RDNA 3's only obvious weakness in hardware terms, so an APU with an extra 4 CUs plus much-improved ray tracing is pretty appealing. The possible snag is battery life.\n\nAMD didn't mention battery life at all in its release materials for the new APU. It also didn't talk about process nodes. Now that AMD has listed the chip on its website, we can see, perhaps unsurprisingly, that Strix Point is built on the TSMC N4 node, which is a refined version of TSMC N5.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nIn other words, exactly the same silicon as the existing Phoenix and Hawk Point APUs. That's slightly worrying. As well as the new GPU, Strix Point also has up to 12 new Zen 5 CPUs.\n\nAnnoyingly, for now, AMD is restricting the full 16 CU version of the GPU to the top-spec 12-core APU model. Arguably, a handheld gaming device doesn't need that many CPU cores. And 12 CPU cores plus 16 higher-clocked GPU CUs, all on the same silicon node as the previous APU, sounds awfully power-hungry.\n\nFor now, all we know for sure is that the two Strix Point APUs kick off at 15 W TDP whereas the previous-gen APU went down as low as 9W TDP. However, that 9 W spec was for the handheld-specific version of the old APU, the mainstream laptop version had the same 15 W minimum TDP as Strix Point.\n\nLong story short, we just don't know how Strix Point is going to perform in terms of efficiency. Strictly speaking, we don't actually know for sure that it's going into handhelds. Maybe if it is a real power hog, it won't be suitable.\n\nHowever, we suspect some version of it will make it into handhelds. At worst, it would make sense to use the 12 CU, 8 core variant and get the benefit of Zen 5 and RDNA 3.5.\n\nThere's also a slight worry over the new APU's memory bus. It remains a fairly modest 128-bit item shared with the CPU cores. That could be something of a performance bottleneck given the relatively beefy spec of the iGPU.\n\nWhatever, watch this space. We'll update you as soon as we know more about AMD's exciting new APU.",

            "title": "AMD Unveils Ryzen 9000 CPUs For Desktop, Zen 5 Takes Center Stage at Computex 2024",
            "summary": "During AMD's Computex 2024 kick-off keynote, AMD's CEO, Dr. Lisa Su, officially unveiled and announced the company's next generation of Ryzen processors. Today marks the first unveiling of AMD's highly anticipated Zen 5 microarchitecture via the Ryzen 9000 series, which is set to bring several advancements over Zen 4 and the Ryzen 7000 series for desktop PCs, which will launch sometime in July 2024.\n\nAMD has unveiled four new chip SKUs using its Zen 5 microarchitecture. The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X processor will be the new consumer flagship part, featuring 16 CPU cores and a speedy 5.7 GHz maximum boost frequency. The other SKUs include, 6, 8, and 12 core parts, giving users a varied combination of core and thread counts. All four of these initial chips will be X-series chips, meaning they will have an unlocked multipliers and higher TDPs/clockspeeds.\n\nIn regards to performance, AMD is touting an average (geomean) IPC increase in desktop workloads for Zen 5 of 16%. And with the new desktop Ryzen chips' turbo clockspeeds remaining largely identical to their Ryzen 7000 predecessors, this should translate into similar performance expectations for the new chips.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 9000 series will also launch on the AM5 socket, which debuted with AMD's Ryzen 7000 series and marks AMD's commitment to socket/platform longevity. Along with the Ryzen 9000 series will come a pair of new high-performance chipsets: the X870E (Extreme) and the regular X870 chipsets. The fundamental features that vendors will integrate into their specific motherboards remain tight-lipped. Still, we do know that USB 4.0 ports are standard on the X870E/X870 boards, along with PCIe 5.0 for both PCIe graphics and NVMe storage, with higher AMD EXPO memory profile support expected than previous generations.\n\nAMD Ryzen 9000: Bringing Up to 16C/32T of Zen 5 to Desktop\n\nZen 5 is AMD's latest advancement in Ryzen microarchitecture. While AMD hasn't disclosed many technical details, we know some of the brand-new features that Zen 5 will offer.\n\nAMD Desktop CPU Generations AnandTech Ryzen 9000\n\n(Granite Ridge) Ryzen 7000\n\n(Raphael) Ryzen 5000\n\n(Vermeer) CPU Architecture Zen 5 Zen 4 Zen 3 CPU Cores Up to 16C / 32T Up To 16C / 32T Up To 16C / 32T GPU Architecture RDNA2 RDNA2 N/A GPU Cores 2 2 N/A Memory DDR5-5600 DDR5-5200 DDR4-3200 Platform AM5 AM5 AM4 CPU PCIe Lanes 24x PCIe 5.0 24x PCIe 5.0 24x PCIe 4.0 Manufacturing Process CCD: TSMC N4\n\nIOD:TSMC N6 CCD: TSMC N5\n\nIOD: TSMC N6 CCD: TSMC N7\n\nIOD: GloFo 12nm\n\nLooking at architectural differences between the last couple of generations (Zen 4 and Zen 3) and Zen 5, we know that AMD uses a new manufacturing process for its Ryzen 9000 desktop chips. While many have touted and speculated that Zen 5 for desktops will be built on one of TSMC's N3 (3 nm) nodes, some of our sources are saying that the Zen 5 CCD will be fabbed on TSMC N4 – though we are awaiting official confirmation about this (Update: And TSMC 4nm is now confirmed for the consumer Ryzen CCD). Furthermore, AMD's mobile counterpart offering, the Ryzen AI 300 series (Strix Point) has been confirmed for 4nm, and we've yet to see an AMD desktop CPU die produced on a more advanced node than its mobile counterpart.\n\nWhile AMD is not offering a deep dive into the Zen 5 architecture at Computex, the company did touch upon a few of the major architectural improvements over Zen 4 that will be coming with the new CPU architecture. These start with an improved branch predictor, which is designed to offer better accuracy, efficiency, and reduced overall latency of instruction cycles. The Zen 5 architecture also boasts higher throughput with wider pipelines and SIMDs, allowing for faster data processing and equating to better overall performance in benchmarks such as CineBench and Blender and workloads leveraging the AVX-512 instruction set.\n\nAdditionally, Zen 5 introduces a deeper out-of-order instruction window size across its design, enabling more parallelism and better handling of multiple instructions within the pipeline simultaneously.\n\nThere are also a couple of points within the Zen 5 architecture where AMD has doubled up on resources or performance. L2 to L1 memory bandwidth is one such example, giving the cache hierarchy a big bandwidth boost that should allow for faster data transfers within the individual CPU cores. AMD also claims better AI performance in inferencing and AVX-512 workloads. Notably, AMD's AVX-512 support on Zen 4 was executed using a 256-bit SIMD over 2 cycles, so this may be a sign that AMD has expanded their AVX-512 SIMDs to a full 512-bits wide in the Zen 5 architecture. (Update: This has since been confirmed by AMD. Zen 5 now has a full 512-bit wide SIMD for processing AVX-512 instructions)\n\nThese enhancements collectively aim to deliver significant performance gains over the previous Zen 4 microarchitecture, with AMD touting an average (geomean) 16% IPC uplift over Zen 4 in desktop workloads. It should be noted, however, that the top result in this benchmark collection is in the GeekBench 5.3 AES XTS benchmark, which leverages the VAES512 and VAES256 extensions of the AVX-512 instruction set. So AMD's AVX-512 SIMD changes greatly impact that benchmark in particular (though not exclusively).\n\nAbove is a render of a Ryzen 9000 series chip with two core complex dies (CCDs), which depicts the silicon's composition and layout. As with previous generations of Ryzen processors, there's a large central I/O die (IOD), through which all I/O and memory operations are routed. As for the CCDs, each die once again contains 8 CPU cores, with AMD equipping Ryzen chips with either 1 or 2 CCDs depending on the SKU. The new Zen 5 CCDs are being fabbed on one of TSMC's 4nm processes (AMD hasn't confirmed which flavor), which is a modest shrink from the N5 process used for Zen 4 CCDs.\n\nMeanwhile, although AMD hasn't confirmed that they're reusing the Ryzen 7000 series IOD here, all signs currently point to the Ryzen 9000 IOD being similar or identical to it. In particular, it is fabbed on the same TSMC N6 process, with the same 2 RDNA graphics CUs, and it offers the exact same off-chip I/O capabilities (though the latter is admittedly also dictated by the AM5 socket).\n\nAMD's Ryzen 9000 chips will also feature similar memory support as their predecessors, with AMD sticking to DDR5. However, AMD does note that the incoming X870E and X870 motherboard chipsets will allow for faster EXPO memory profiles than seen on Zen 4. As it stands, AMD hasn't disclosed the JEDEC memory specification of the four Ryzen 9000 SKUs that it announced today. However, we expect to find out more before the July 2024 launch of the Ryzen 9000 family. And according to AMD's product pages posted since the keynote, the Ryzen 9000 family will top out at JEDEC DDR5-5600 speeds for in-warranty configurations.\n\nAMD Ryzen 9000 Series Processors\n\nZen 5 Microarchitecture (Granite Ridge) AnandTech Cores /\n\nThreads Base\n\nFreq Turbo\n\nFreq L2\n\nCache L3\n\nCache TDP MSRP Ryzen 9 9950X 16C / 32T 4.3GHz 5.7GHz 16 MB 64 MB 170 W TBC Ryzen 9 9900X 12C / 24T 4.4GHz 5.6GHz 12 MB 64 MB 120 W TBC Ryzen 7 9700X 8C / 16T 3.8GHz 5.5GHz 8 MB 32 MB 65 W TBC Ryzen 5 9600X 6C / 12T 3.9GHz 5.4GHz 6 MB 32 MB 65 W TBC\n\nThe announcement of Zen 5 for desktop by AMD and the impending Ryzen 9000 offers four X-series SKUs at launch, allowing for overclocking and coming with unlocked CPU multipliers.

Finally, the entry-level SKU, the Ryzen 5 9600X, has just 6 cores, a max boost clock of up to 5.4 GHz, 32 MB of L3 cache, and a 65 W TDP.\n\nThe next slide denotes the flagship Zen 5 chip. The Ryzen 9 9950X is up against Intel's current 14th Gen Core i9-14900K. In productivity and content creation tasks, the Ryzen 9 9950X shows a 7% improvement in Procyon Office, a 10% increase in Puget Photoshop, and a 21% uplift in Cinebench R24 nT. More notably, it exhibits a 55% performance boost in Handbrake and a 56% increase in Blender.\n\nInterestingly, the gaming data shows marginal gains in some titles, although it highlights more significant uplifts in others. AMD's in-house testing shows that the Ryzen 9 9950X outperforms the Intel Core i9-14900K by 4% in Borderlands 3, 6% in Hitman 3, and 13% in Cyberpunk 2077. Further, it achieves a 16% improvement in F1 2023, a 17% gain in DOTA 2, and a 23% increase in Horizon Zero Dawn.\n\nAs we've mentioned, AMD is committed to extending its AM5 socket for longevity, at least much more than other vendors offer with their CPU launches and updates. As such, AMD's Ryzen 9000 series operates on the current AM5 platform. And while Ryzen 9000 is fully backwards compatible with existing 600 series boards, AMD has also readied two new 800 series motherboard chipsets for the launch of Zen 5 on desktops. The X870E (extreme) and X870 chipsets will be featured on numerous new motherboards at launch, and a big part of Computex this week will be the motherboard vendors (most of whom are local Taiwanese firms) showing off their new wares.\n\nAMD has offered just a handful of details about their X870E and X870 chipsets. Of particular note, USB 4.0 support is going to be standard on all X870(E) motherboards, whereas it was optional on X670(E) series boards. X870(E) boards will also feature Wi-Fi 7 support (up from 6E on the 600 series), and at least one PCIe 5.0 NVMe slot continues to be mandatory. AMD also notes that motherboards based on both platforms \"feature 44 total PCIe lanes,\" which would break down as 24 lanes from the CPU, and another 20 lanes coming from the chipset.\n\nAMD AM5 Chipset Comparison Feature X870E X870 X670E X670 B650E CPU PCIe (PCIe) 5.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 CPU PCIe (M.2 Slots) At Least 1 PCIe 5.0 Slot Total CPU PCIe Lanes 24 Chipset PCIe Lanes (Max) 4.0: 12\n\n3.0: 8 4.0: 8\n\n3.0: 4 4.0: 12\n\n3.0: 8 4.0: 8\n\n3.0: 4 USB4 Mandatory\n\n(Discrete, Consumes 4 Chipset PCie 4.0 Lanes) Optional SATA Ports (Max) 8 4 8 8 4 DDR5 Support Quad Channel (128-bit bus) Wi-Fi Wi-Fi 7 (Discrete) Wi-Fi 6E (Discrete) CPU Overclocking Support Yes Memory Overclocking Support Yes # of Chips 2 1 2 2 1 Silicon ASMedia Promontory 21 Available July 2024 July 2024 Sept. 2022 Sept. 2022 Oct. 2022\n\nFor the moment, different AMD resources are in conflict with each other about PCIe 5.0 – or, at least, aren't being very clear about it. According to AMD's AM5 chipset page, both X870 and X870E feature PCie 5.0 for both the CPU NVMe lanes and CPU PEG lanes. However AMD's Compute press release states that X870E is \"differentiated with 24 PCIe 5.0 lanes, with 16 lanes dedicated to graphics,\" implying that the vanilla X870 won't mandate PCIe 5.0 support. We're poking around AMD and the motherboard vendors to find out more.\n\nLooking under the hood, AMD has confirmed that the new chipsets aren't based on new silicon. Instead, the company is using the same ASMedia-produced design as in the X670/B650 chipsets: the Promontory 21 controller. Given that the feature sets of the newer X870E/X870 motherboards are fundamentally similar to those of the X670E/X670 motherboards, aside from using newer external controllers such as Wi-Fi 7, there's apparently little need to change the chipset itself. Though given the lack of significant changes, it does raise the question of why AMD has skipped a generation in its nomenclature (700-series anyone?) and went straight to the 800-series chipset.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 9000 series, including the flagship Ryzen 9 9950X (16C/32T), the Ryzen 9 9900X (12C/24T), the Ryzen 7 9700X (8C/16T), and the entry-level Ryzen 5 9600X (6C/12T) is expected to hit retail channels sometime in July 2024. At the time of writing, AMD is not providing pricing.",

CGTN Screen Shot | License Photo\n\nJune 2 (UPI) -- After a month-long journey, a Chinese spacecraft has landed on the far side of the moon, the China National Space Administration said. Chinese space administration officials have said they intend to collect rock and soil from this notoriously difficult-to-reach region of the lunar surface for the first time in history, the CNSA said. Advertisement\n\n\"Everyone is very excited that we might get a look at these rocks no-one has ever seen before,\" Professor John Pernet-Fisher, who specializes in lunar geology at the University of Manchester, told the BBC.\n\n\"Applause erupted at the Beijing Aerospace Flight Control Center\" when the Chang'e landing craft touched down on the Moon early on Sunday morning, the Chinese state broadcaster said.\n\nChinese space scientists landed the Chang'e 6 craft in a crater known as the Apollo Basin. \"The choice was made for the Apollo Basin's potential value of scientific exploration, as well as the conditions of the landing area, including communication and telemetry conditions and the flatness of the terrain,\" said Huang Hao, a space expert from the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuang said rugged terrain on the far side of the moon makes it harder to navigate than the front, or near, side, and has fewer flat surfaces that lend themselves to a successful landing. It also reduces the windows to communicate with the uncrewed craft.\n\nThe craft hovered about 300 feet above the moon's surface, scanning it with 3D technology before landing. Chinese space officials called the touchdown an \"historic moment.\"\n\nChang'e 6 will now begin a three-day exploration of the lunar surface, gathering material as part of a mission that the CNSA said would include \"many engineering innovations, high risks and great difficulty.\"\n\nMost prominently, the Chang'e 6 will seek to extract some of the oldest known rocks to exist on the lunar south pole.\n\nPernet-Fisher said the chance to analyze rocks and other objects from a completely different part of the moon could answer fundamental questions about how planets form.\n\nMost of the rocks collected so far are volcanic, similar to what we might find in Iceland or Hawaii, he said. But the material on the far side would have a different chemistry.\n\n\"It would help us answer those really big questions, like how are planets formed, why do crusts form, what is the origin of water in the solar system?\" Pernet-Fisher said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChina is the only country to have ever landed a module on the back side of the moon, having done so the first time with its Chang'e 4 spacecraft in 2019.",

It's another crucial milestone for the mission – the first of its kind. The probe was launched on May 3 and entered lunar orbit on May 8.

It was 6:23 p.m. EDT (2223 GMT) on June 1 at the time of the landing. The probe \"successfully landed in the pre-selected area,\" China's space agency said.\n\nThe China National Space Administration (CNSA) now has two far-side landings under its belt — this one and Chang'e 4, which dropped a lander-rover combo onto the gray dirt in January 2019. No other country has done it once.\n\nA depiction of China's Chang'e 6 moon lander on the far side of the moon after landing on June 2, 2024. (Image credit: CCTV)\n\nAnd Chang'e 6 will make further history for China, if all goes according to plan: The mission aims to scoop up samples and send them back to Earth, giving researchers their first-ever up-close looks at material from this part of the moon.\n\n\"The Chang'e-6 mission is the first human sampling and return mission from the far side of the moon,\" CNSA officials said in a translated statement. (To be clear: Chang'e 6 is a robotic, not crewed, mission.) \"It involves many engineering innovations, high risks and great difficulty.\"\n\nRelated: China's Chang'e 6 mission has a big lunar mystery to solve\n\nSampling a new environment\n\nChang'e 6 launched on May 3 with a bold and unprecedented task: haul home samples from the moon's far side, which always faces away from us. (The moon is tidally locked to Earth, completing one rotation on its axis in roughly the same amount of time it takes to orbit our planet. So observers here on Earth always see the same side of our natural satellite.)\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nEvery lunar surface mission before Chang'e 4 targeted the near side, largely because that area is easier to explore. It's harder to communicate with robots operating on the far side, for example; doing so generally requires special relay orbiters, which China launched ahead of both Chang'e 4 and Chang'e 6. China's newest moon relay satellite, called Queqiao-2, aided the Chang'e 6 landing, CNSA officials said.\n\nChang'e 6 arrived in lunar orbit about four days after liftoff. It spent the next few weeks scrutinizing its planned landing site and gearing up for today's big event, which went according to plan: Chang'e 6's lander came down softly in Apollo Crater, leaving the mission's orbiter, with its attached Earth-reentry module, circling the moon.\n\nDiagram showing the various phases of the Chang'e 6 lunar sample-return mission. (Image credit: CNSA)\n\nThe lander will spend the next few days studying its surroundings and collecting about 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms) of lunar dirt and rock. Some of these samples will be scooped from the surface and some will be dug from up to 6.5 feet (2 meters) underground, using Chang'e 6's onboard drill.\n\nThis material will then be launched into lunar orbit by a rocket that rode down with the lander. The sample container will rendezvous with the Chang'e 6 orbiter, then make the long trek back to Earth, eventually touching down here under parachutes on June 25.\n\nChang'e 6 is also carrying a tiny moon rover and has a variety of scientific experiments onboard the lander.\n\nThe China National Space Administration's Chang'e 6 sample-return probe and its mini-rover (circled) seen before launching to the far side of the moon. (Image credit: CAST)\n\nScientists will study the returned material in detail, seeking insights about the moon's history and evolution and clues about why the lunar far side is so different than the near. The dark volcanic seas known as maria are common on the near side, for example, but are rare on the far side, for reasons that remain mysterious.\n\nResearchers will doubtless compare the Chang'e 6 material to the samples collected on the moon's near side by Chang'e 5, which came down to Earth in December 2020. (Chang'e 5 and Chang'e 6 are sister missions, with virtually identical architectures.)\n\nRelated: The moon: Everything you need to know\n\nBig lunar dreams\n\nThe Chang'e moon program, which is named after the Chinese moon goddess, has launched increasingly complex and ambitious missions over the past 17 years.\n\nChang'e 1 and Chang'e 2 sent orbiters to the moon in 2007 and 2010, respectively. Chang'e 3 marked China's first trip to the lunar surface, putting a lander-rover duo on the near side in late 2013. Chang'e 4 landed a similar pair on the far side in early 2019. Chang'e 5-T1 launched a test capsule around the moon and back to Earth in 2014, proving out the gear that could get lunar samples here safely, which Chang'e 5 did in late 2020.\n\nAnd there are more missions to come. Chang'e 7 is scheduled to launch in 2026 to assess the resource potential of the moon's south polar region, which is thought to harbor large stores of water ice. Chang'e 8, which will lift off two years later, will test ways to use those resources on-site — building a structure out of lunar dirt and rock, for example.\n\nAnd all of this robotic work will lead to something even bigger, if all goes according to plan: crewed missions to the moon, which China aims to start launching by 2030. The nation wants to build an astronaut outpost near the south pole called the International Lunar Research Station later in the 2030s, with help from partners such as Russia, Belarus and Pakistan.\n\nThe United States has similar aims with its Artemis program, which is targeting late 2026 for its first crewed lunar landing. The U.S. is also building a moon-exploration coalition via a diplomatic framework called the Artemis Accords; more than 40 nations have signed on to date.",

            "summary": "HELSINKI — China’s Chang’e-6 mission lander made a successful soft landing on the far side of the moon late Saturday and will soon begin collecting unique lunar samples.\n\nThe Chang’e-6 lander made a soft landing at 6:23 p.m. Eastern June 1 (2223 UTC), the China National Space Administration (CNSA) announced shortly after the event. The lander targeted a southern portion of Apollo crater within the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) Basin on the lunar far side.\n\nThe landing is a critical step towards bringing unique and scientifically invaluable lunar samples to Earth for analysis. U.S. decadal surveys have highlighted an SPA sample return as a highest priority science objective.\n\nThe Chang’e-6 lander used a variable 7,500-newton-thrust engine to slow its velocity in lunar orbit and begin its descent. The lander was scheduled to make rapid positional adjustments at an altitude of around 2.5 kilometers above the lunar surface before continuing its descent. The spacecraft entered a hovering phase for fine hazard avoidance at approximately 100 meters above the surface. It used light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and optical cameras to find a safe landing spot.\n\nChang’e-6 is China’s fourth successful lunar landing from four attempts, and the second on the far side of the moon. It is also the third lunar landing in 2024. It follows Japan’s SLIM in January and Intuitive Machines’ IM-1 Odysseus lander in February.\n\nTeams will now begin initial checks of the lander’s systems and soon begin collecting samples. The lander will collect up to 2,000 grams of samples, using a scoop to grab surface regolith and a drill for subsurface material. Samples are expected to be sent into lunar orbit within around 48 hours. Chinese space authorities have yet to publish a timeline for the mission and its steps, however.\n\nThere are complex stages remaining before samples can be returned to Earth for analysis. Yet the success of this critical stage of the mission will be celebrated.\n\n“I have been analyzing the scientific data of the Chang’e-4 mission that landed on the far side of the moon, and I am constantly excited to have new findings from the ongoing rover data. Therefore, I am particularly excited about the Chang’e-6 mission” Xu Yi, an assistant professor at the Macau University of Science and Technology, told SpaceNews earlier in the week.\n\n“The reasons for the asymmetry in the scale of volcanic activity between the lunar nearside and farside are still subject to different hypotheses. Chang’e-6 will probably collect lunar samples from various sources, including products of local volcanic activity. Dating and compositional analysis of these samples will provide more ground truth information about volcanic activity on the far side.”\n\nSamples could contain material ejected from the lunar mantle. These would provide insights not only into the depths of the moon, its composition and its evolution, but also for the Earth the wider history of the early solar system.\n\nChang’e-6 next steps\n\nFollowing sampling, an ascent vehicle will be expected to launch itself and the samples from atop the Chang’e-6 lander. The launch is expected within around 48 hours of landing, taking the samples into lunar orbit. The ascender will need to rendezvous and dock with the waiting Chang’e-6 orbiter.\n\nSamples would then be transferred to a reentry capsule and ahead of the journey back to Earth. Departure from the moon will take place at a calculated time. The orbiter would then release a reentry capsule just ahead of its return to Earth, around June 25. The capsule will first bounce off the atmosphere once and target a landing in grasslands of Inner Mongolia. Samples would then be transferred to special facilities for handling, analyzing and storing the lunar material.\n\nThe Chang’e-6 mission also uses support from the Queqiao-2 relay satellite. This allows communications with the otherwise hidden far side of the moon.\n\nLunar rover, science payloads\n\nBeyond the precious samples, the Chang’e-6 lander also carries further payloads for conducting a range of science objectives. A small rover is expected to be deployed onto the surface for short term operations.\n\nInternational payloads include the Negative Ions at the Lunar Surface (NILS) payload developed by the Swedish Institute of Space physics and the Detection of Outgassing RadoN (DORN) instrument from France. An Italian passive laser retro-reflector is aboard the lander. The lander will then suffer damage from the launch of the ascent module, likely ending surface operations.\n\nChang’e-6 is part of China’s broader lunar program. The country will follow up with two missions to the south pole of the moon. These are Chang’e-7 in 2026 and Chang’e-8 around 2028. The country aims to launch its first crewed lunar mission by 2030.\n\nBoth sets of missions are part of a plan to establish a permanent lunar base. This project is known as the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) program, planned for the 2030s. A number of countries and organizations have signed up to the project.\n\nMission Name Launch Date Mission Type Objectives Outcome Chang’e 1 October 24, 2007 Orbiter Lunar mapping, study lunar surface and environment Successful; created a 3D map of the moon.

As a result, they said, his motives and the reason for his attack required further investigation.\n\nPoliticians pay tribute, police union warns of 'daily' violence\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz said he was \"deeply dismayed\" to hear that the officer had died.\n\n\"His dedication to everyone's safety deserves the very highest respect,\" Scholz said.\n\nThe state premier of Baden Württemberg, where Mannheim is located, Winfried Kretschmann, said the news \"shocks me to the core,\" and offered condolences to the victim's family, friends and colleagues.\n\n\"This awful crime puts the often incalculable risks police officers are exposed to daily painfully before our eyes,\" Kretschmann said. \"We owe them the highest respect and reverence as a society.\"\n\nState Interior Minister Thomas Strobl said \"these are moments where the world seems to stand still.\"\n\n\"He gave his life because he stepped in to protect other people,\" Strobl said of the 29-year-old officer. Other regional politicians rushed to pay similar tributes.\n\nThe head of the state chapter of one of Germany's main police trade unions, meanwhile, voiced not only sorrow but also frustration.\n\n\"The violence that we face daily is merciless, brutal, inhuman and often fatal,\" Ralf Kusterer said.\n\nRival protests and responses to Friday's knife attack meant that police were back in operation in central Mannheim on Sunday Image: Thomas Frey/dpa/picture alliance\n\nMannheim police back in action in city center amid rival rallies in response\n\nMeanwhile, police were present in numbers in central Mannheim again on Sunday, amid at least three public demonstrations in response to the attack.\n\nA cross-party organization had called for a human chain to be formed through much of the city center against violence and hate, attracting between 800 and 1,000 people, according to the police.\n\nAt the same time, the youth wing of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party organized a demonstration of around 150 at the market square under the motto \"remigration would have prevented this crime,\" in reference to the party's preferred term for forced repatriation of people with migrant backgrounds.\n\nLeft-wing antifascist activists also showed up for a spontaneous counter-demonstration that had not been registered beforehand. Police could be seen clashing with these protesters and encircling or \"kettling\" them, with law enforcement saying this was to stop them from attacking the far-right protesters.\n\n\"Around 15:15, a group of people, some obscuring their faces, tried to disturb the gathering at the market square and violently advance on them. Some of these people were armed with torches. The attack on the market square could be prevented by a swift police intervention. In this context it was necessary to use pepper spray,\" Mannheim police said of the incident.\n\nPolice said they took down the personal information of the 40 people involved in the counter-protest. One was being investigated for allegedly assaulting a police officer.\n\nmsh/ab (AFP, dpa)\n\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

            "summary": "A teacher in Massachusetts has been placed on leave for holding a mock slave auction during a history lesson and using a racial slur in a fifth-grade classroom, bringing fresh attention to how slavery is taught in U.S. schools. The incidents occurred this year at the Margaret A. Neary Elementary School in Southborough, Superintendent Gregory L. Martineau said in a letter to parents.\n\nThe teacher, who is not identified in the letter, held “an impromptu slave auction” in January where two children of color were made to stand as the class discussed their physical attributes, the letter said. The incident happened during a history lesson on the economy of Southern colonies.\n\n“Simulations or role plays when teaching about historical atrocities or trauma are not appropriate, and these teaching methods are not to be used,” Martineau wrote, adding that students of color are disproportionately impacted by such “unsound” teaching methods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA report by the Southern Poverty Law Center published in 2018 on the challenges of teaching the history of slavery in the United States identified simulations as part of the problem.\n\nSuch techniques, the report said, “cannot begin to convey the horror of slavery and risk trivializing the subject in the minds of students.”\n\nShare this article Share\n\nBut similar incidents have been reported in recent years from multiple states. In North Carolina, a Black student was “sold” for $350 during a mock slave auction at a majority-White school in 2022. A fifth-grade teacher in New York state in 2019 instructed Black students to raise their hands and placed the students in imaginary chains before proceeding to conduct a mock auction in class.\n\nThe Massachusetts teacher also used the n-word in a fifth-grade classroom in April while reading and discussing a book that was not included in the school’s curriculum, superintendent Martineau said in the letter. The book also did not contain the n-word, according to Martineau’s letter. After the matter was brought to the school’s attention, the teacher called out the student who reported the incident in class, which Martineau said was “not acceptable.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly after, the Public Schools of Northborough and Southborough launched an investigation and put the educator on paid leave, the letter said, adding that personnel matters will remain confidential. The school’s principal was also put on 10-day administrative leave in May.\n\nMartineau apologized to the parents and acknowledged “missteps.” The school will implement a series of reforms, he said, including a professional development plan focusing on culturally competent teaching methods.\n\n“Many American schools and educators continue to have difficulty teaching the history of American slavery in an empathetic and sensitive way because our nation has not reckoned with this history in any meaningful way,” said Stephanie E. Jones-Rogers, a professor of history at University of California at Berkeley.\n\nThe teaching of the history of slavery, she added, has come under attack from some politicians who have sought to limit the content or legislate the ways it can be taught.",

During the lesson, the teacher reportedly held an “impromptu mock slave auction,” asking two students of color sitting at the front of the classroom to stand up so their peers could discuss their physical attributes such as teeth and strength, Martineau said.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe second incident occurred in April when the teacher was reading a book aloud. The book was recommended by a colleague but not a part of the fifth grade core English curriculum, according to Martineau.\n\n“In reading and discussing the text, the educator used the ‘N-word.’ It was later brought to the District’s attention that the ‘N-word’ does not appear in the book,” Martineau’s letter reads.\n\nMartineau called the teacher’s actions “unacceptable” and said simulations like a mock slave auction when teaching about “historical atrocities or trauma” are “not appropriate.” He cited research that shows such “simulations” are disproportionately traumatic for students of color.\n\nMartineau did not name the involved teacher and said that “all personnel matters will remain confidential.”\n\nPrincipal placed on leave during district investigation\n\nLater, the teacher met with parents of students in the class and the principal of the school in an effort to “be transparent with families and take responsibility for mistakes,” Martineau said.\n\nThe next day, the teacher “called out” a student who had reported the teacher’s use of the racial slur, he wrote.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nMartineau said that after that incident, the district began a formal investigation and placed the teacher on paid administrative leave. Principal Kathleen Valenti was also placed on leave from May 6 to May 16.\n\n“Paid administrative leave allowed for a thorough and unbiased investigation,” Martineau wrote. “Currently, the District is engaged in due process procedures with the educator who remains on leave.”\n\nMartineau said the district will take steps to improve “cultural competency” going forward, including developing a plan focusing on “culturally competent” teaching, strengthening internal reporting and investigatory procedures, and working with families and students impacted by the teacher’s actions to help them transition to sixth grade.\n\n“I apologize for the events that took place in The Public Schools of Southborough,” Martineau wrote. “I acknowledge that there were missteps in this process that further complicated the situation.”\n\nSix Southwick students held “mock slave auction” earlier this year\n\nThe incident comes on the heels of a similar episode in February when eight graders in a different Massachusetts town, Southwick, were caught participating in “a hateful racist online chat that included heinous language, threats, and a mock slave auction.”\n\nHampden District Attorney Anthony Gullini announced in March that the six students involved would be criminally charged for participating in the chat, in which students allegedly used slurs, made racist comments, threatened violence against people of color, and held a mock slave auction with two other people of color they know.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nGulluni’s office said at the time it would partner with Attorney General Andrea Campbell’s office to create a program to combat racism in schools.",

The text, however, did not contain the slur and was not an approved part of the fifth-grade curriculum, according to Mr Martineau.\n\nA fifth-grade teacher at Margaret A Neary Elementary School, pictured, is on paid leave after using a racist slur and forcing students to participate in a ‘mock slave trade' ( Google Maps )\n\n“Dehumanizing words such as slurs should not be spoken by employees or students,” the superintendent wrote. “Using such words can harm students and negatively impact an open discussion on a particular topic.”\n\nThe teacher also retaliated against the student who reported the use of the racist slur, “inappropriately” calling out the student after parents, the principal and the educator had a meeting to discuss the two incidents. Mr Martineau called this response “unacceptable.”\n\nNow, the educator is being investigated while on paid leave. The school’s principal, Kathleen Valenti was also placed on paid leave from 6 May to 16 May, Mr Martineau said.\n\n“I apologize for the events that took place in The Public Schools of Southborough,” the superintendent wrote. “I acknowledge that there were missteps in this process that further complicated the situation.”\n\nIn response to these incidents, the school district will be creating a “professional development plan focusing on culturally competent pedagogy that will be implemented in the fall,” Mr Martineau said.",

SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\nShares more than doubled in premarket trading on Monday morning, though gains later pared to $40.60 per share at the time of writing, a jump of around 75%. The rally comes after Keith Gill, who uses the handle “Roaring Kitty” on YouTube and X, formerly Twitter, posted a screenshot on social media suggesting he holds a nearly $116 million position in the game retailer. According to the portfolio screenshot, which he shared on Reddit’s r/Superstonk forum — he goes by the handle “DeepFuckingValue” on the platform — Gill holds 5 million shares of GameStop purchased at $21.27 per share. The post also revealed 120,000 call options — purchased for around $5.68 each and worth around $65.7 million — due to expire on June 21 with a strike price of $20. Gill’s post has not been independently verified by Forbes.\n\nCrucial Quote\n\nUnder his Roaring Kitty handle, Gill posted a cryptic image of an UNO reverse card on X. The card is used to reverse the direction of play in the popular card game and in recent years the card has gained traction as a meme to indicate a comeback or some form of karmic retribution. As of writing, the post, which does not contain any text, has been viewed 5.6 million times.

Solana-based memecoin GME has skyrocketed more than 230% over the last 24 hours and now has a market capitalization of $94.5 million.\n\nKey Background\n\nGill is a legend among retail traders on social media and helped fuel a rally in meme stocks like GameStop back in 2021 through his posts on forums like Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets. Gill has been largely absent from social media in the time since, though made a splash when he began posting again last month, reigniting a flurry of popular interest in the stocks. Gill’s return triggered a multi-day rally that pushed GameStock shares to nearly $50, though it lost around half of this value until his most recent posts.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nForbes GameStop Storms 110% Toward Best Day Since 2021 On Return Of Meme Stock Folk Hero 'Roaring Kitty'",

            "title": "Simone Biles cruises to 9th national title and gives Olympic champ Sunisa Lee a boost along the way",
            "summary": "FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — There used to be a time when Simone Biles would find “beauty in the blindness” ahead of the Olympics, reveling in not knowing what she didn’t know.\n\nThat was eight years ago. Back when she was still just a teenager. Still kind of “ditzy.”\n\nThose days are long gone. The evidence isn’t just on Biles drivers’ license or her marriage certificate but in how the now 27-year-old is able to see beyond herself. The tunnel vision that most great athletes have in pursuit of greatness has fallen away.\n\nAnd maybe that’s the biggest difference between the national title the gymnastics star won on Sunday night — her ninth, this one with an all-around total of 119.750 — and her first over a decade ago.\n\nThe defining moment of Biles’ victory wasn’t a twist, a turn or a jump, but a walk.\n\nIt came early on, when Biles watched 2020 Olympic champion and good friend Sunisa Lee spin awkwardly in the air during her vault and landed on her back, a mixture of surprise and fear spreading across her face.\n\n“I was kind of thinking that this was over,” Lee said.\n\nThen Biles appeared at her side, unprompted. She knew exactly where Lee was in that moment better than anyone.\n\nThree years ago at the Tokyo Games, a similar wayward vault by Biles started a chain of events that led to her withdrawing from multiple competitions and dragging the discussion on the importance of mental health front and center.\n\nWatching Lee, who has spent most of the last two years battling kidney issues that have made her weight yo-yo and complicated her training, try to gather herself, Biles left her World Champions Centre teammates and gave Lee the kind of support Biles relied on so heavily back in Japan.\n\n“I know how traumatizing it is, especially on a big stage like this,” Biles said. “And I didn’t want her to get in her head, so we just went and talked about it.”\n\nThe two retreated off the floor to talk, with Biles reminding Lee she “could do hard things.”\n\nWhen they returned, Biles stood next to the uneven bars cheering Lee on as she rebounded with a brilliant (if somewhat watered down) routine that scored a 14.500 and helped her finish a promising fourth.\n\n“I know I was having a hard time and she was just there to help lift me up,” Lee said.\n\nBiles is at a stage in her unparalleled career where the joy she gets from the sport is no longer centered strictly on the quality of her performance.\n\nWhile she joked that she believes she’s “aging like fine wine,” it’s telling that she saved her biggest smile afterward when talking about the five World Champions Centre teammates — most of them a decade younger — who will join her at Olympic trials in Minneapolis later this month.\n\n“That’s kind of what excites me because I think they have long careers ahead of them,” Biles said. “So if I can do anything to help them, right now and in the future, that’s what I’m going to do.”\n\nIt’s her way of giving back. She is well aware of the spotlight that awaits her in Paris and is trying to set an example for others on how to navigate the pressure that lies ahead. She’s become a regular in therapy — now even during meet weeks — and is determined to focus on what she can control.\n\nLike say, her gymnastics.\n\nIn front of an audience that included her husband, Chicago Bears safety Jonathan Owens, Biles put on a four-rotation clinic that featured all the trademarks of a typical Biles performance. There was jaw-dropping athleticism mixed with precision and more than a splash of swagger.\n\nBiles finished with the highest two-day score on all four events, something she’d done only once before at nationals (2018).\n\nHer only misstep on Sunday came on vault. She came up short on her Yurchenko double pike — two back flips with her hands clasped behind her knees — during warmups and overcompensated when it counted, generating so much force she wound up on her back. She still received a 15.000 for her effort, a testament to a vault that’s never been completed in competition by another woman and only attempted by a select group of men.\n\nNot that it bothered her. Biles collected herself, took a couple of deep breaths then followed it up a Cheng vault that was rewarded with a 15.1 and put a ninth national title within reach. No other gymnast in the history of the sport in the U.S. has more than seven.\n\nWhile Biles remains above the fray as usual, there is plenty of competition for the other four spots on the five-woman U.S. team that will head to Paris as heavy favorites to return to the top of the podium after finishing second to Russia in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nSkye Blakely, 19, put together another impressive performance and will head to Minneapolis with plenty of momentum. Three years after her bid to make the 2020 Olympic team ended with an injury, Blakely is peaking at the right time.\n\nLee remains a picture of elegance on bars and beam, her best events, and was encouraged after her first elite all-around competition since she triumphed in Tokyo while Biles cheered from the stands.\n\nOlympians Jordan Chiles and Jade Carey are in the mix, though both endured falls on beam on Sunday. Third-place finisher Kayla DiCello slipped off the uneven bars.\n\nThen there’s Shilese Jones, considered the best all-around gymnast in the U.S. without the last name Biles, pulled out of the championships on Friday, citing a shoulder injury though she said Sunday she was feeling better and plans to be available for trials. So will 18-year-old Kaliya Lincoln, who opted not to compete on Sunday after tweaking something during Friday night’s opening session.\n\nBoth — if healthy — figure to be serious contenders to earn an invitation to Paris (Jones in particular).\n\nBiles’ ticket is essentially punched. Same as it ever was.\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games",

She won the gold medal on all four apparatuses and was nearly perfect throughout the entire competition as she gears up for a third Olympics run this summer in Paris.\n\nThe win in Texas officially clinched a spot for Biles in the U.S. Olympic Trials later this summer.

She fell once on the vault while trying to come out of her signature Yurchenko double pike. That cost her a one-point deduction and marked her first fall of the season.\n\nThe win on Sunday came after Biles rolled through the field at the U.S. Classic last month to win the all-around title. Skye Blakely finished in second place with a 113.850. She narrowly beat out Kayla DiCello, who won the bronze medal with a score of 110.800. Shilese Jones didn't participate due to a shoulder injury. Both Jones and Kaliya Lincoln were granted petitions to participate in the Olympic Trials.\n\nBiles is getting back into the swing of things in the lead up to the Olympics later this summer after she both led Team USA to the team title at the World Gymnastics Championships last fall and earned The Associated Press’ Female Athlete of the Year award in 2023.\n\nThough she will still go through qualifying later this summer, Biles is sure to be one of the most-followed athletes in the world in France for the Olympics. It will mark her first games since she experienced the \"twisties\" at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo and sat out multiple competitions in what was a stunning development for the four-time Olympic gold medalist.\n\nOnce again, though, Biles seems like she’s back to her old self. The Olympic trials will kick off on June 27 in Minneapolis, about a full month before the opening ceremony in Paris.",

            "summary": "FORT WORTH — Winning a national title is not supposed to look this easy. And it’s not normal for the same gymnast to stand atop the podium time and time again for more than a decade. But this is Simone Biles, and for her, the extraordinary is routine. The pressure of an Olympic year and the otherworldly expectations that follow Biles everywhere haven’t rattled her. She cruised through the national championships as she so often has, winning her ninth U.S. all-around title Sunday night in a testament to her longevity and excellence.\n\n“I use the phrase ‘aging like fine wine,’ ” Biles said. “... It’s just getting better and better. We’ll see. Hopefully we get to ride this out for the rest of the year.”\n\nOne successful routine at a time, Biles proved she might be better than she has ever been. The 27-year-old’s all-around score of 119.750 was nearly six points ahead of runner-up Skye Blakely’s 113.850. Biles also won the gold medals on all four apparatuses, each one a reminder of how she’s poised to rack up more gold in Paris this summer despite the trouble she had in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiles makes the world’s most difficult routines appear effortless because of how she performs them so consistently without errors. Her only mistake during this two-day competition came Sunday night, when she rolled backward out of her difficult Yurchenko double pike vault, a one-point deduction and her only fall this season. Otherwise, she was fantastic.\n\nSkip to end of carousel Build your own U.S. Olympic gymnastics team Choosing an Olympic gymnastics team is a complicated puzzle. Try to select your own gymnasts and see how your team performs. End of carousel\n\nBiles didn’t come back after Tokyo with simpler, safer routines. She came back better.\n\nThis is all about Biles competing against herself. That’s how it has to be when you have long been the best gymnast in the world and you could win the national title while making several major errors. After the U.S. Classic last month, Biles asked Coach Cecile Landi whether she had broken the 60.000 benchmark in the all-around, which no woman had done during this Olympic cycle. Biles fell just short with a 59.500. Taking that leap became her goal, even with the quick turnaround between her season debut and the national championships. She soared past that mark with a 60.450 on the first night of the women’s competition here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLandi admitted that Friday was perhaps Biles’s best outing but quickly added: “It’s not even the skills. It’s the attitude and her behavior. I really feel like she’s happy to be here. I know she says she’s ready to be done, but I think she’s really enjoying it and appreciating every meet she gets to do.”\n\nOn Sunday, the fall on vault brought down her all-around score, but on the other apparatuses Biles repeated her strong routines from two days earlier.\n\nHer unflappable performances are a product of her work in and out of the gym. Biles has harped on her commitment to therapy and how that effort has steadied her over the past year. As she rotates around the arena, with one dominant performance after another, she’s unfazed by the roars and squeals that accompany her every move.\n\n“It took a lot mentally and physically to trust my gymnastics again and most importantly trust myself,” she said. “I think that was the hardest part after Tokyo — I didn’t trust myself to do gymnastics.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now she’s back to routines just as difficult as the ones she performed in the lead-up to the Tokyo Games.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nBiles’s floor performance is a highlight of any competition she enters. She opened by launching herself into the air, flipping twice and completing three full twists. It’s one of the hardest skills in women’s gymnastics, and Biles landed perfectly upright, with a step out of bounds just a minor mistake. Altogether, she tallied a 7.1 difficulty score, which means her maximum score is a 17.100, while many others are thrilled to earn around a 14.000. When the world’s best gymnasts performed in the floor final at last year’s world championships, the non-Biles competitors averaged a difficulty score of 5.6.\n\nThose complex routines are why Biles always holds such an advantage, and the scores show she’s on a different level. Biles notched a 15.200 and 15.100 on floor here, while only two others reached 14.000. When she lands her Yurchenko double pike, she has a similar-size edge on that event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome gymnasts view the season as a months-long progression toward their best performances. Not Biles. Sure, Landi sees ways Biles can improve — elevating her artistry on floor, hitting her handstands more precisely on bars and consistently connecting her leap series on beam — but this weekend’s version of Biles, two months out from Paris, would take the Olympic all-around title easily. This has long been Biles’s winning formula. She doesn’t ease in to anything. She is excellent at one meet after another, year after year.\n\n“She needs to feel confident, and this is how she feels confident — competing well,” Landi said. “It builds up for her, and this is how it works.”\n\nBiles will perform twice more at the Olympic trials, and then it’s on to Paris, where she is in line to face pressure and attention unlike anything she has experienced since Tokyo. The clips of Biles flailing through the air during her botched vault, exiting the Olympic arena and then watching from the sideline will return to the forefront. Nothing she experiences over the next two months can match the stress that Paris will bring, but each strong performance offers reassurance before the final, ultimate test.",

            "summary": "The WNBA dropped the hammer Sunday on the Sky.\n\nFirst came the news that the league had upgraded guard Chennedy Carter’s away-from-the-play personal foul on Fever rookie Caitlin Clark in the third quarter Saturday to a Flagrant 1 foul after review.\n\nAbout an hour later, the WNBA announced rookie forward Angel Reese had been fined $1,000 for failing to make herself available to the media after the Sky’s 71-70 loss.\n\nWNBA media protocol requires teams to make two key players and each head coach available after the game following no more than a 10-minute cooling-down period. Interviews take place in a news-conference-style setting, but any player not participating may be requested to appear by in-person media. That policy, which was negotiated by the players’ union, was implemented last year to replace locker-room access.\n\nAfter the game Saturday, Carter, rookie center Kamilla Cardoso and coach Teresa Weatherspoon were made available for interviews. Reese, however, wasn’t made available, even after multiple media members asked to speak with her.\n\nSky & the media: A rocky relationship\n\nThe Sky have a history of not abiding by the WNBA’s media policy. After their 86-82 loss on May 25, to the Sun, the team didn’t make players or Weatherspoon available until 30 minutes after the game ended. Delaying postgame interviews has been a common practice for the Sky through the years.\n\nFailing to make players available is another pattern that dates to the Sky’s appearance in the 2019 playoffs. Despite media members asking to speak with her, former Sky guard Courtney Vandersloot wasn’t made available after the team’s 93-92 loss to the Aces.\n\nAfter the Sky’s mass exodus of players in free agency in 2023, the media were told ownership would be available to answer questions at media day. No one showed up.\n\n‘‘It honestly has become the Sky’s reputation,’’ said Terrence Tomlin, the co-founder of The Bigs, a media company based in Chicago.\n\nFlagrent 1 foul in WNBA – what are the consequences?\n\nCarter’s foul is a separate issue with its own implications. Players accrue points for flagrant fouls that can lead to fines and suspensions. Carter’s Flagrant 1 foul earned her one point. A player with three points faces the risk of a one-game suspension, and a player with four or more points faces a one- to two-game suspension.\n\nWhen asked about the foul after game, Carter responded by saying, ‘‘Next question.’’\n\nCarter had more to say later on the social-media platform Threads, where she criticized Clark, posting: ‘‘Beside three point shooting what does she bring to the table man.’’ Carter also defended Reese, who appeared to applaud Carter’s hit, calling her ‘‘my dawg fasho.’’\n\nComparisons have been made between Carter’s foul on Clark and Sun star Alyssa Thomas’ Flagrant 2 foul on Reese on May 25, but there are differences between them.\n\nThomas committed the foul on a basketball play. Officials immediately reviewed the play, and she was assessed a Flagrant 2 foul and ejected. Carter’s foul on Clark, however, came as the players waited for the ball to be inbounded, and officials didn’t review it in the moment.\n\nHad officials reviewed Carter’s foul at the time and upgraded it to a Flagrant 1 foul, Clark would have shot two free throws instead of one.",

            "summary": "As it turns out, Chicago Sky guard Chennedy Carter had something to say about Indiana Fever rookie guard Caitlin Clark after all.\n\nCarter took to the social media platform Threads and replied to a post that included her postgame media remarks following the Sky’s 71-70 loss on Saturday against the Fever.\n\nThe Athletic’s Nicole Auerbach shared Carter’s exchange from Threads on her account on X.\n\n“& that’s that on that cause beside three point shooting what does she bring to the table man,” Carter wrote on Threads.\n\nDuring the game, Carter was assessed an away-from-the-play foul on Clark as she body-checked Clark before Aliyah Boston’s inbound pass just before the end of the third quarter. After a league review, the WNBA upgraded the foul to a Flagrant 1, though Carter was not fined.\n\nChennedy Carter bumped Caitlin Clark for an away from the play foul 😳 “That’s not a basketball play,” Clark told ESPN on the broadcast. pic.twitter.com/udTMmWFVyn — The Sporting News (@sportingnews) June 1, 2024\n\nAsked to comment on the sequence and her foul on Clark, Carter declined to comment following the Saturday loss.\n\n“I ain’t answering no Caitlin Clark questions. I don’t know what she said. I didn’t say anything,” Carter told reporters.\n\nWNBA fans had a wide range of reactions to the sequence featuring Carter and Clark. Many believed it crossed the line, and some thought it was an indication of Carter and the league’s jealousy of Clark.\n\nDuring the game, Clark was interviewed in between the third and fourth quarters where she was asked to comment on the foul.\n\n“Yeah, that’s just not a basketball play. But you know, I’ve gotta play through it, that’s what basketball is about at this level,” Clark said.\n\nFever head coach Christie Sides defended Clark on social media on Saturday, calling the foul “unacceptable.”\n\n“This is unacceptable WNBA. When will the consistent complaints be heard?!? Something has to be done!” Sides posted on X.\n\nSides also celebrated Clark’s in-game response to the sequence.\n\n“We’re just going to keep sending these possessions to the league, and these plays, and hopefully they’ll start, you know, taking a better look at some of the things that we see happening, or we think is happening.\n\n“Just more happy that Caitlin handled it the way she did. You know, it’s tough to keep getting hammered the way she does and to not get rewarded with free throws or foul calls. She’s continued to fight through that. Appreciate that from her. Really, really proud of her for doing that,” Sides said.\n\nClark ended her day with 11 points, eight rebounds, six assists and one steal. The 6-foot rookie guard shot 4-for-11 from the field, including 2-of-9 from 3-point range.\n\nDuring the Fever win, Clark joined Sabrina Ionescu as the only players in WNBA history to register 150-plus points, 50-plus rebounds and 50-plus assists in their first 10 career games.\n\nClark and the Fever return to action in a prime-time affair versus the New York Liberty at 6 p.m. on NBA TV on Sunday.\n\nContact/Follow us @HawkeyesWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Iowa news, notes and opinions.\n\nFollow Josh on X: @JoshOnREF\n\nStory originally appeared on Hawkeyes Wire",

            "title": "Angel Reese, Chicago Sky fined for breaking WNBA's rules on media availability after loss to Fever",
            "summary": "The WNBA announced Sunday that Angel Reese and the Chicago Sky have been fined for failing to follow the league's rules on media responsibilities after the team's 71-70 loss to the Indiana Fever. That game was the first professional meeting between Reese and No. 1 overall pick Caitlin Clark.\n\nThe league's full press release:\n\nAngel Reese of the Chicago Sky has been fined $1,000 for failing to make herself available to the media for interviews following the game on Saturday, June 1 vs Indiana, the WNBA announced today. In addition, the Sky organization has been fined $5,000 for failing to ensure that all players comply with WNBA media policies.\n\nHere is what the league's media access policy says about postgame media availability:\n\n• No later than 10 minutes following the game, each head coach and two players (leading scorer and key contributor) per team will be available in the separate press conference rooms for in-person and zoom media. • Additional player interviews: After the conclusion of a team's press conferences, any players not participating at the podium may be requested (through team PR) for interviews by in-person media ONLY. Such \"additional players\" will be required to be available for interviews in a suitable, alternate location such as the interview room or hallway outside the locker room. There is no zoom requirement for the interviews with additional requested players outside of the press conference. • ALL players are required to remain in the building (whether requested or not) until all media obligations are met.\n\nThe Sky brought Chennedy Carter and Kamilla Cardoso to the podium along with coach Teresa Weatherspoon. There, Carter did not answer questions about the incident in the third quarter in which she put a shoulder into Clark, which was later upgraded to a Flagrant 1 foul upon league review Sunday.\n\nAs Reese was not at the podium, she was supposed to be available to in-person media outside the locker room. It is unclear why Reese did not speak.\n\nReese finished the game with eight points and 13 rebounds, and is now averaging 10.6 points, 8.9 rebounds and 1.3 steals for the season. She is second in scoring, first in rebounding and first in steals among rookies, and her 5.0 offensive rebounds per game lead the league.",

            "summary": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nEDMONTON, Alberta -- For the Edmonton Oilers, the journey from worst to first in the Western Conference is complete. And now a chance at the Stanley Cup is their reward.\n\nConnor McDavid had a goal and an assist in the opening period to get Edmonton going, Stuart Skinner stopped 34 shots for his hometown team and the Oilers capped an improbable run to the Stanley Cup Final by beating the Dallas Stars 2-1 on Sunday night.\n\nZach Hyman also scored -- like McDavid, on a first-period power play -- and Evan Bouchard had two assists for the Oilers, who won the Western Conference finals in six games and will play for the Cup for the first time since 2006.\n\nEdmonton now heads to Florida to face the Panthers in Game 1; the series is set to open Saturday night. At 2,540 miles between Edmonton and Sunrise, Florida, it's the longest distance between Stanley Cup Final opponents in NHL history.\n\nThe Panthers opened as -125 favorites to win the Cup at ESPN BET, with the Oilers underdogs at +105.\n\nEdmonton is the first Canadian team to make the Final in a non-COVID-19-affected season since the 2011 Vancouver Canucks. The last Canadian team to win the Cup was the Montreal Canadiens in 1993.\n\n\"When the horn went off, that's the loudest I ever heard it,\" McDavid told Sportsnet amid the on-ice postgame celebration as Edmonton fans chanted, \"We want the Cup\" over and over. \"Special place to play, honestly. So much history. And these fans, it was great to hear their support.\"\n\nMason Marchment scored midway through the third period and Jake Oettinger stopped eight shots for the Stars, who finished the regular season with the second-best record in the NHL -- 113 points, just one behind the New York Rangers in the race for the Presidents' Trophy.\n\nBut the Stars, just like the Rangers, let a 2-1 lead in the conference finals get away. Dallas scored five goals in Game 3 to take the series lead; the Stars managed four goals, total, in the next three games.\n\n\"I would probably argue that was our best game of the series,\" Stars forward Jamie Benn said. \"Didn't go our way.\"\n\nOettinger went to the bench with about 2:20 to go, but the Stars got only two shots the rest of the way, their desperate tries to tie the game and extend the series coming up short.\n\n\"Proud of our group, proud of our fight, proud of our battle,\" Stars coach Peter DeBoer said. \"You're just gutted. They did leave everything out there. We should be going to play a Game 7; we're not. You have to give Edmonton credit. Their power play, particularly over the last two games, was good, their goaltender was good. It's fine lines when you get to this point of the year, and they were on the right side of it. ... It's tough to swallow.\"\n\nJust by getting to the Cup Final, Edmonton has done something truly extraordinary -- making the title series after finding itself 10 points out of a playoff spot during the regular season. Entering games Nov. 24, the Oilers were 5-12-1, 10 points back of Seattle and St. Louis for the final wild-card spot in the West and 19 points behind Vegas for the top spot in the conference.\n\nThose days are long forgotten now.\n\nThat's when the Oilers -- a couple of weeks after Kris Knoblauch took over as coach for Jay Woodcroft, who was dismissed following a 3-9-1 start -- went on an eight-game winning streak and began the long climb out of the NHL's basement.\n\nStarting with that eight-game win streak, the Oilers -- who had a 16-game winning streak not long after the eight-game run ended -- were the best team in the NHL for the remainder of the regular season. They were 44-15-5 the rest of the way, leading the league in goals (239) and goal differential (plus-76) in that span.\n\nAnd now, the Final awaits. Much like the Panthers on Saturday night, the Oilers didn't touch the conference championship trophy in the postgame celebration. It's the bigger trophy that they're seeking.\n\n\"We're not done here,\" Edmonton's Mattias Ekholm said. \"This is just one step in the right direction for us.\"\n\nEdmonton is just the third team in NHL history to make the Final after being 10 points or more out of a playoff spot; the others were Toronto in 1958-59 and St. Louis in 2018-19. The Blues won the Cup that season.\n\nThe Oilers had only three shots in the first period of Game 6. They were enough.\n\nMcDavid opened the scoring with a spectacular goal, weaving through traffic before beating Oettinger up high for a 1-0 lead.\n\n\"Connor McDavid, doing Connor McDavid things,\" Skinner said.\n\nAdded Oilers forward Leon Draisaitl: \"There's one player in the world that can make things like that happen.\"\n\nMcDavid then found Hyman in the slot for another power-play score late in the first; the shots at that point were 6-3 Dallas, but the score was 2-0 Edmonton and the Oilers were on their way. The Oilers finished with only 10 shots on goal, the fewest by a team in a playoff win since 1990.\n\n\"We hung in there. We got it done,\" McDavid said. \"Everyone deserves it.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Not out best effort, but we hung in there. Found a way to get a win ... Just hung in there. It wasn't pretty, but we got it done.\"\n\nMcDavid — who will play in the Stanley Cup Final for the first time in his career — got the Oilers on the board right away. After an early power play, McDavid found the back of the net off a pass from Leon Draisaitl not even five minutes into the opening period.\n\nThat marked his 30th point of the playoffs this spring, which made him the sixth player in NHL history to record multiple 30-point playoff years.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN KICKS OFF GAME 6 🫡 pic.twitter.com/RBOz18VsOI — Edmonton Oilers (@EdmontonOilers) June 3, 2024\n\nThen late in the period, McDavid found Zach Hyman to extend the lead.\n\nMason Marchment put the Stars on the board midway through the third period, and Dallas outshot the Oilers 11-2 to open the final period. That push came too late. The Oilers held on down the stretch to grab the one-goal win and secure their trip to the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nThe Oilers, after cruising through their opening-round series against the Los Angeles Kings, needed all seven games to reach the conference finals after a tight series with the Vancouver Canucks. They then got the jump on the Stars with a huge 3-2 double overtime win in Game 1 of the series. After dropping two straight, the Oilers won three in a row to close it out and reach the Final.\n\nThe Stars, on the other hand, have come up short again. Dallas, after losing in the Stanley Cup Final in 2020, reached the conference finals for a second straight year this season under head coach Peter DeBoer. The Stars, despite earning the top seed in the playoffs, were knocked out early for a second consecutive year.\n\nThe Oilers are headed to the Stanley Cup Final for the first time in nearly two decades.

The Panthers are now in the Stanley Cup Final for a second straight year and a third time in team history. They fell to the Las Vegas Golden Knights last season.\n\nThe Panthers improved by 10 wins and 18 points this season and won the Atlantic Division title before the postseason started. They then closed out the Tampa Bay Lightning in five games in the opening round before beating both the Boston Bruins and the Rangers to secure a spot in the finals.\n\nGame 1 of the Stanley Cup Final is set for Saturday night in South Florida.",

Circuit Civil Court late last month, allege McManus rubbed against them during the Jaguars’ charter flight to London on Sept. 28. The women worked as flight attendants for Atlas Air, according to the complaint. The Jaguars were on their way to play games in London against the Atlanta Falcons and Buffalo Bills.\n\nThe women claim the flight “quickly turned into a party” as McManus and other players violated air travel safety regulations. According to the lawsuit, McManus “recruited” three other flight attendants and handed out $100 bills to encourage them to drink and “dance inappropriately for him.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement Sunday night, McManus’s attorney, Brett R. Gallaway, responded to the Commanders’ decision to release his client.\n\n“Brandon would like to thank the Washington Commanders for the opportunity to be a part of the organization,” he said. “However, we reiterate that the allegations against Brandon are and remain absolutely false and, importantly, are contradicted by indisputable evidence and the accusers’ own prior inconsistent statements and omissions. While we are disappointed with the team’s decision to release Brandon before he had the opportunity to defend against these fabricated claims, we will aggressively defend and clear Brandon’s name and reputation through the legal process. We intend to defeat these claims, fully exonerate him and look forward to seeing him back on the field where he belongs.”\n\nNFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said Monday, when news of the lawsuit broke, that the league was aware of the situation and had been in contact with the Commanders, who acknowledged in a statement through a spokesperson that evening that they were made aware of the lawsuit earlier that day. “We take allegations of this nature very seriously and are looking into the matter,” the statement read. The Jaguars, who were named defendants in the lawsuit, said Monday that they were aware of the complaint and acknowledged “the significance of the claims.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the court filing, Jane Doe I accused McManus of attempting to kiss her while she was strapped into the jump seat amid turbulence during the flight. The woman allegedly put her hand up to block McManus’s unwanted advance.\n\nMcManus grabbed Jane Doe I and grinded against her on two occasions as she served in-flight meals, the lawsuit alleges, adding that during the first instance, she made eye contact with another Jaguars player who appeared ashamed of his teammate’s behavior. The second instance happened under similar circumstances, according to the lawsuit: Jane Doe I was serving the second in-flight meal, and McManus again grabbed her by the waist and “rubbed his clothed but erect penis on her multiple times.”\n\nJane Doe II claimed McManus acted similarly with her during the second in-flight service. According to the complaint, he grinded against Jane Doe II and she could not push him away because she was holding a tray in the galley aisle. When Jane Doe II turned around and confronted McManus, he “smirked and walked away,” the filing alleges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe women claim to have sustained “pain and suffering and psychological and emotional distress, mental anguish, embarrassment, and humiliation.” They are seeking damages in excess of $1 million and a jury trial. McManus and the Jaguars have until June 17 to respond to the complaint.\n\nThe Jaguars were accused of negligence for failing to properly hire McManus, educate him on inappropriate sexual contact, supervise his conduct in flight, create and implement a zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate behavior and create a safe environment for the airplane staff.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nIn an interview with “The Junkies” on 106.7 the Fan on Thursday, Tony Buzbee, lead counsel for the plaintiffs, alleged McManus brought alcohol on the team plane, which the NFL prohibits.\n\n“I know that alcohol was brought onto the plane, and I know that there was a back-and-forth between flight attendants and some of the players, including, allegedly, Mr. McManus,” Buzbee said. “He was saying, ‘I know you can’t pour my alcohol, but at least can you pour my chaser?’ — that kind of silliness. There will be witnesses that will talk about intoxication and how intoxicated certain individuals were and how they became so intoxicated so quickly into the flight.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NFL prohibits alcohol at team facilities and during travel to or from games, a rule it emphasized in a 2022 memo after then-Commanders quarterback Taylor Heinicke was photographed with a beer in his hand during a postgame flight. The Florida court filing also alleges the women could smell marijuana coming from the airplane’s restrooms.\n\nBuzbee told 106.7 that Lisa Friel, the NFL’s special counsel for investigations, contacted him shortly after the filing, hoping to talk with his clients. Buzbee also claimed in an Instagram post last week that, before filing the lawsuit, his firm attempted to resolve the matter outside of the court system.\n\n“Our efforts at resolution were met with arrogance, ignorance and stupidity, strikingly similar to how Deshaun Watson’s team responded when we tried to resolve those cases pre-filing,” wrote Buzbee, who represented all but one of the quarterback’s accusers of sexual misconduct.\n\nMcManus signed a one-year deal with the Jaguars in 2023 after spending the previous nine seasons with the Denver Broncos, helping boost them to a Super Bowl 50 victory during the 2015 season. New Commanders general manager Adam Peters was Denver’s assistant director of college scouting at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcManus signed with the Commanders on a one-year, $3.6 million contract in March to replace Joey Slye. By releasing McManus, the Commanders may have to eat up to $1.5 million in dead money under the salary cap from his signing bonuses. It could be less, though, depending on the forfeiture language in his contract and if McManus violated it by not informing the Commanders of the alleged incident before he signed.\n\nIn his interview with The Junkies, Buzbee said the plaintiffs worked with another attorney before turning to him, but after taking over, he issued letters to McManus’s agent and the Jaguars.\n\n“When I couldn’t find a solid address [for McManus], we sent it to his agent. And once we sent it to his agent, we got his attention pretty quick,” Buzbee said. “We also sent it to the Jaguars organization, but I think we only sent it to them a week before the lawsuit was filed.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor six-plus years, Washington relied on Dustin Hopkins at kicker, but a string of misses led to his departure early in the 2021 season and a carousel of replacements. There was a failed experiment with Chris Blewitt that season (three missed field goals in two games), an interim stint with Brian Johnson as Slye recovered from an injury and then two mostly decent years with Slye before McManus’s arrival.",

The plaintiffs claim McManus sexually assaulted them. McManus has denied all allegations of wrongdoing.\n\nIt’s unclear whether and to what extent the Commanders conducted an investigation, or whether they simply decided that the distraction outweighs the expected contributions.\n\nHere’s an interesting twist. Atlas Air Worldwide, the company that flew the Jaguars to London, is owned by Apollo Global Management. Apollo was co-founded by Commanders majority owner Josh Harris.\n\nPer a source with knowledge of the situation, Harris continues to own Apollo stock, although he’s no longer on the board of directors and otherwise has no role in the management of the company.

A smaller group from the alliance, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, will also extend voluntary cuts of 1.7 million barrels per day. Saudi Arabia's energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said OPEC+ wants concrete rate cuts before factoring in the potential impact on energy demand. Separately, oil giant Saudi Aramco began a massive share sale to raise around $12 billion to fund the country's continued attempts to diversify its economy.\n\nNew AI chip Rubin\n\nNvidia unveiled its next generation artificial intelligence chip, Rubin, a mere three months after launching its Blackwell model.

The firm hopes to raise $1.05 billion through this sale. This move is intended to pave the way for an initial public offering. The sale is expected to attract new investors and provide liquidity for existing ones.

(0:50)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nEASTLAKE, Ohio -- There is indeed crying in baseball, and for Birmingham-Southern, there were also many tears of joy.\n\nA magnificent, almost magical postseason ride ended in heartbreak.\n\nMore heartbreak.\n\nThe Panthers' inspiring run, which came as the liberal arts college in Alabama was being shut down for financial failure after more than 160 years, ended Sunday with an 11-10 loss to Wisconsin-Whitewater in the Division III College World Series.\n\nIt was a painful, seemingly unfair finish for a never-say-die team that had lifted a tight-knit community devastated by the school's closing while captivating the hearts of American sports fans who could relate to the Panthers' feel-good story, a mixture of loss, grief and pride.\n\n\"I don't feel sadness right now and I mean it,\" said coach Jay Weisberg, who took over BSC's program in 2007 and built into one of the nation's strongest at the D-III level. \"The ride that these guys have given me this year has been absolutely incredible.\n\n\"Coaching is what I love, and these guys have made it so fun.\"\n\nBirmingham-Southern built a 10-5 lead through six innings, but couldn't put away Wisconsin-Whitewater, which scored two runs in the seventh, three in the eighth and got a walk-off homer from Sam Paden leading off the ninth.\n\nSomeone had to be the villain.\n\nWhen Paden's homer cleared the wall in left, several Birmingham-Southern players stood still as if frozen in disbelief.\n\nThere wouldn't be a storybook ending after all.\n\nAfter briefly gathering his team in the outfield, Weisberg had his players and the alums who had made the trip from all over the country to see the Panthers one last time stand single file along the third-base line.\n\nTogether they tipped their caps to the BSC fans in the ballpark, a final salute from a team that will never play again. The players then walked off the field in small groups, hand in hand.\n\nThe salute was something Weisberg had planned, a full-circle moment for him and players he had touched.\n\nWeisberg managed to keep his composure during the early portion of his news conference before being asked what he hoped would be the final message of Birmingham-Southern.\n\n\"What a beautiful place it is ... was,\" he said before breaking down in tears.\n\nWeisberg took 25 seconds to compose himself before continuing and speaking about a school that has defined his life.\n\n\"I know a lot of people have pride in their schools, and they should,\" he said. \"We aren't different than many. But it's such a beautiful place, physically. We have the best sunsets in the world. The message about Birmingham-Southern is that it changed lives. It was a place where people came as young men and women and left as mature men and women.\n\n\"What this nation has seen over these last three weeks and the joy that we brought is exactly what this program is -- it's toughness, it's championship baseball, great young men. I love it that the final chapter for Birmingham-Southern could have gone off into the sunset and not many people besides graduates or the Birmingham community would know about it.\n\n\"But now the nation knows there were some pretty special things that happened here.\"\n\nThe doors at BSC were officially shut on Friday as the Panthers opened the eight-team double-elimination tournament with a loss to Salve Regina.\n\n\"What this nation has seen over these last three weeks and the joy that we brought is exactly what this program is -- it's toughness, it's championship baseball, great young man.

In March, the school announced it would close, and the baseball team went on a miraculous run to clinch a spot in the DIII College World Series with the help of a GoFundMe campaign.\n\nDespite the school shuttering its doors on Friday due to financial difficulties, the Panthers defeated Randolph-Macon 9-7 on Saturday with a walk-off home run in Eastlake, Ohio, to stay alive in the NCAA’s annual college baseball tournament.\n\nThey completed their win in dramatic fashion when, with the score tied 7-7 heading into the bottom of the ninth inning, first baseman Jackson Webster hit a two-run walk-off home run to continue on the school’s “Cinderella story.”\n\nIt sparked delirious scenes in the crowd and at watch parties back in Birmingham while Webster was mobbed by his teammates who were all waiting for him at home plate.\n\n“Baseball miracle, right?” Webster said, per the NCAA. “The storybook isn’t finished. It’s a hard pill to swallow. We don’t have anything to go back to so we take the field like we don’t have anything to lose. And a team that has nothing to lose is a team that’s hard to beat.”\n\nThe Panthers had jumped to an early 4-0 lead by the bottom of the third but faltered in the middle innings after a series of mistakes and trailed 7-4 by the eighth. After losing their opening game on Friday, they had to win this one to remain in the tournament and even their head coach had doubts creep into his mind.\n\n“You just had the feeling of this is how it’s going to end,” Weisberg said afterwards, according to the NCAA. “What this team has been through in particular … with all that we’ve had hanging on our heads, there had to be some thoughts.\n\n“I’ll admit it happened to me for a brief second in between innings. I started thinking about what am I going to say, am I going to keep it together? And I just told myself stop, just stop.”\n\nBirmingham-Southern third baseman Mitch Austin fields a ball during practice earlier this week. Sue Ogrocki/AP\n\nThen, all three of their pinch hitters delivered at the plate in the ninth inning, giving Webster an opportunity to seal the victory, though on his first swing he mistimed his effort so badly that he tapped his chest to apologize. He connected on the third pitch, however, and sent it over the left field wall for a famous win.\n\nAlong with the GoFundMe page, Topps announced earlier this week it was producing trading cards featuring Birmingham-Southern’s baseball team with some of the proceeds going to the program. Topps also said it was giving some cards to “distribute to players, friends & family.”\n\nCNN’s Steve Almasy contributed to this report.",

Now, the program is finished as well.\n\nSam Paden hit a home run — his second of the game — in the bottom of the ninth inning to give Wisconsin-Whitewater an 11-10 win in an elimination game at the Division III College World Series in Eastlake, Ohio. The Warhawks will play Salve Regina on Monday for a chance to go to the tournament semifinals.\n\nUW-Whitewater previously won the Division III championship in 2005 and 2014.\n\nSURVIVE AND ADVANCE:\n\n\n\nWhitewater ends Birmingham-Southern's Cinderalla run, completing a comeback on a Sam Paden walk-off homer.@UWWBaseball is one of four teams left in the DIII College World Series.\n\n\n\n📷: NCAA pic.twitter.com/bUDDBIGVx0 — Andrew Bandstra (@andrewbandstra) June 2, 2024\n\nBirmingham-Southern drew national attention when the baseball team advanced to the DIII World Series, outlasting the life of its actual institution. The private liberal arts college in Birmingham, Alabama with an enrollment of 1,300 students closed due to financial difficulties after 168 years of existence. The school shut its doors on May 31, the same day that the Panthers opened tournament play.\n\nUW-Whitewater opened the scoring in the second inning with its outfielders battering Panthers starting pitcher Carter Tyus. Paden and Dominik McVay hit back-to-back home runs, each working 3–1 counts before going deep. The Warhawks added another run on an RBI single from Matt Scolan to build a 3–0 lead.\n\nScolan adds on with an RBI single for another Warhawk run.\n\n\n\nScolan moves up to 3rd on the Single Season RBI leaderboard for UW-Whitewater with 69 RBIs\n\n\n\nUWW up 3-0 heading to the top of the 3rd#d3baseball #PoweredByTradition pic.twitter.com/vebm360JYb — UWW Baseball (@UWWBaseball) June 2, 2024\n\nThe Panthers roared back\n\nMcVay followed up with an excellent catch in the third, diving onto the warning track in left center field to rob Ty Truett of a leadoff extra-base hit. However, Birmingham-Southern came right back with a two-run shot by Eli Steadman to make it a 3–2 ballgame.\n\nIn the fourth, Jackson Webster led off with a home run to tie the score. That was the beginning of BSC jumping on Hagen with a double from Ian Hancock, a Charlie Banks triple and a Jakob Zito single that resulted in two more runs and a 5–3 lead.\n\nA STEADMAN 💣 GETS US RIGHT BACK IN IT! pic.twitter.com/ObnxnhoRnM — BSC Athletics (@BSCsports) June 2, 2024\n\nLet the slugfest in Eastlake begin\n\nYet the Warhawks punched right back, tying the score on a two-run homer by Scolan. And what turned into a slugfest in an elimination game was on.\n\nBirmingham-Southern exploded for four runs in the fifth inning, started by a catcher's interference call, three consecutive hits and a hit-by-pitch. That chased reliever Cade Hansen, but Max Huseboe came in to allow an RBI single by Zito.\n\nThe Panthers tacked on another run in the sixth for a 10–5 lead, but UW-Whitewater scored runs in the seventh and eighth — both fueled by hits from Scolan — to chip away at the deficit.\n\nFRANK DOES FRANK THINGS\n\n\n\nEli Frank ties it up with a 2-run BOMB to left center\n\n\n\nIt's a 10-10 game with 2 outs in the bottom of the 8th pic.twitter.com/vsrwEMmgWR — UWW Baseball (@UWWBaseball) June 2, 2024\n\nThat set up first baseman Eli Frank to launch a two-run homer off Hansen McCown to tie the score at 10–10 in the eighth. The Warhawks threatened to take the lead, following up with two straight singles. Andy Thies hit a deep drive to left center, but Steadman caught it at the warning track to end the inning.\n\nBirmingham-Southern lost Friday's opener to Salve Regina, putting them at risk of elimination with another loss. However, the Panthers defeated Randolph-Macon in a thrilling comeback, walk-off win on Saturday to stay alive in the tournament. The win provided another opportunity to advance for a rematch with Salve Regina, but that won't happen now.\n\nA compelling story reaches its end\n\nBirmingham-Southern College, founded in 1856, fought for the past two years to restore its endowment. Unfortunately, legislation for a $30 million loan that would've kept the school open did not pass in the Alabama State House. In March, the college decided to close.\n\nFrom the bottom of our hearts, thank you @BSCBaseball ❤️ pic.twitter.com/HC3puCuiu4 — BSC Athletics (@BSCsports) June 3, 2024\n\nSince head coach Jan Weisberg informed his players that the school would close, the Panthers went 19–6. Several of the athletes have found new programs where they can play baseball, while Weisberg and his staff are working to help others make such arrangements. Some have decided to walk away from baseball once the season ended. And 10 players on the team have graduated.\n\n\"At the start, there was a lot of sadness,\" Cole Steadman, a member of the 2019 team that played for the Division III title, told the Associated Press. \"We were pretty devastated to hear that the school was shutting down, but to see the community come together has been special.\"",

            "summary": "SAN FRANCISCO -- — Juan Soto homered twice, including a go-ahead drive in a four-run ninth inning against All-Star closer Camilo Doval, and the New York Yankees rallied past the San Francisco Giants 7-5 on Sunday.\n\nGiants starter Blake Snell, a two-time Cy Young Award winner, exited in the fifth with left groin tightness and will undergo an MRI on Monday. He appears headed to the injured list for a second time this season, manager Bob Melvin said.\n\nAnthony Volpe hit an RBI triple and Giancarlo Stanton drove in a run with a ground-rule double against Doval in the ninth.\n\nAaron Judge had two singles while extending his on-base streak to 29 games as the AL East leaders won their fifth straight and completed a 7-2 trip to three California cities with a three-game sweep at Oracle Park.\n\n“We’ve been playing great baseball,” Soto said. “Really happy to come over here and keep doing what we’ve been doing since day one.”\n\nSoto homered off Snell in the first inning, then reached on a bunt single and scored in the fifth.\n\nNew York trailed 5-3 in the ninth before Gleyber Torres got the rally started with a leadoff single. Yankees catcher Jose Trevino grounded into a fielder’s choice, beating out a potential double play, and Volpe sent a line drive into triples alley in right-center to drive in Trevino. Soto followed with his 17th home run to give New York a 6-5 lead, bringing roars from the large chunk of the crowd wearing Yankees gear.\n\nSoto flipped his bat high in the air, pounded his chest and shouted in excitement toward the Yankees’ dugout. New York has homered in a season-high 12 consecutive games.\n\n“I just tried to get something elevated and tried to drive it to the outfield,” Soto said. “It takes every little thing to put an inning like that (together) against a closer of his caliber.”\n\nJudge walked, stole second and continued to third on a throwing error by catcher Curt Casaili before scoring on Stanton’s double to deep right-center.\n\nMelvin stood by his closer despite the loss.\n\n“I felt good with Doval,” Melvin said. “I’ll take him against anybody. It’s just, they got him today.”\n\nMichael Tonkin (2-3) tossed two scoreless innings to earn the win. Clay Holmes worked a perfect ninth for his 17th save.\n\nSoto, the second batter of the game, got the Yankees going when he crushed a 2-2 fastball from Snell into the stands in right-center. The three-time All-Star later laid down a perfect bunt and scored on Alex Verdugo’s two-run double in the fifth.\n\n“That’s some savage at-bats right there,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said of Soto. “Just wow. To get on a pitch like he hit off of Snell to start out … then bookends the day with another homer off Doval. Pretty good day to homer.”\n\nHeliot Ramos homered and drove in three runs for the Giants. Casey Schmitt also connected, and Jorge Soler had three hits. San Francisco has lost four straight.\n\nSnell, the 2023 NL Cy Young Award winner with San Diego, had seven strikeouts and allowed five hits and three runs in his first start against the Yankees since 2020. Snell has not made it through five innings in any of his six starts with the Giants and has a 9.51 ERA.\n\nRamos hit his third homer of the season off Yankees starter Nestor Cortes in the third, then put the Giants ahead with a two-run single off reliever Dennis Santana in the sixth.\n\nCortes had seven strikeouts and no walks in 4 1/3 innings. He gave up seven hits and three walks.

            "title": "5 things to know from the weekend in MLB: With Juan Soto and Aaron Judge crushing at the plate, are the Yankees to be feared again?",
            "summary": "A lot of baseball happens in a weekend. This time around saw the Yankees' superstars crush it in the Bay, the Brewers tighten their grip in the NL Central, the White Sox had fighting words off the field (but not much of it on the diamond) and the Mariners sound serious about fixing their hitting woes.\n\nHere’s what you need to know from the weekend across MLB.\n\nNobody in MLB has more wins than the New York Yankees (42). And that’s because the Bronx Bombers rolled into San Francisco and bullied the Giants behind dominant performances from their superstars. It was the baseball equivalent of a ruthless noogie.\n\nThe series was defined by the storyline of Bay Area kid Aaron Judge playing his first career games at Oracle Park after his dramatic free-agent frenzy broke the hearts of Giants fans (remember Arson Judge?). The big man stole the show in the opener, thumping a pair of big flies to help the Yankees to a 6-2 win. But the next day was truly unforgettable.\n\nIn the first inning of Saturday’s contest, Judge obliterated a Logan Webb changeup for a supersonic 464-foot monster shot in another Yanks victory.\n\n464 FEET 😳\n\n\n\nAaron Judge hits his 21st home run of the season.\n\n\n\n(via @Yankees)\n\npic.twitter.com/RfJC9cvvdj — Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) June 2, 2024\n\nSan Francisco entered the ninth inning on Sunday with a two-run lead, with a chance to salvage the finale. Crucially however, the Yankees employ Juan Soto. After an Anthony Volpe triple cut the lead to one, Soto smashed a grooved Camilo Doval heater into the right-field seats for a one-run lead. It was a Murphy’s Law weekend for the Giants and their fans.\n\nThe Yanks head home after a very successful nine-game California trip — they went 7-2 — for a series against, who else, their all-time punching bag: The Minnesota Twins.\n\nJackson Chourio showers Willy Adames with well-wishes after Adames hit a walk-off single on Saturday. (Photo by John Fisher/Getty Images)\n\nBrewers take advantage of slumping Cubs with sweep of woeful White Sox\n\nMilwaukee took care of business against the woeful White Sox in one of the weekend’s three sweeps. After a 23-hit barrage in the opener, the Brewers edged out the White Sox behind solid pitching in the last two games from rookie Robert Gasser, ace Freddy Peralta and a lockdown bullpen. That makes five consecutive wins for Milwaukee, which, alongside the Cubs' recent nose dive, has given the Brew Crew a sturdy seven-game advantage atop the NL Central.\n\nRhys Hoskins’ return from injury a few days ago will only help the Brewers' surging offense as Milwaukee heads to Philadelphia this week for a scintillating showdown between two of the circuit's best clubs.\n\nThe White Sox, on the other hand, are a catastrophe coated in disaster wrapped in calamity and deep fried in debacle. They have now lost 11 consecutive baseball matches and are MLB’s worst team by a significant margin. At 15-45, Chicago is on pace to finish the season with 40 wins, which would tie them with the 1962 New York Mets for the single lowest winning percentage in MLB’s expansion era.\n\nThings got particularly odd Sunday after fearless veteran outfielder Tommy Pham tried to square up with Brewers catcher William Contreras after a play at the plate. It got relatively chirpy on the diamond, but the 36-year-old Pham — who is almost certainly trade bait for the Sox — took it to another level during his postgame media availability by referencing his offseason fighting regimen.\n\nThe 2024 White Sox are a singular experience.\n\n“There’s a reason I do all kinds of fighting in the offseason. Because I’m prepared to f—- somebody up” -Tommy Pham pic.twitter.com/REBPGPj5BX — CHGO White Sox (@CHGO_WhiteSox) June 2, 2024\n\nExpect Orioles to be active on trade market after losing 2 huge arms\n\nBaltimore general manager Mike Elias dropped a bad news bomb on Friday afternoon, announcing that two of his team’s pitchers, John Means and Tyler Wells, would be undergoing surgery for torn UCLs. For Means, who underwent Tommy John surgery in May 2022 but struggled through his return to play, it’s a particularly cruel blow. Wells had started for Baltimore in the early going, but was likely bullpen bound come late summer. The double-whammy increases the likelihood that Elias acts aggressively at the trade deadline.\n\nIn the short term, Baltimore has to move forward with the best 13 pitchers already in the organization. That task got off to a great start Friday against Tampa when 36-year-old journeyman Albert Suárez delivered five strong frames in a win. On Saturday, the Birds slugged four long balls in a 9-5 win before the Rays returned with a comeback victory Sunday.\n\nIt's not surprising that Baltimore can really hit, but how the Orioles go about assembling their solid, not dominant pitching staff in the face of these recent injuries is crucial to their long-term success. Good to see Craig Kimbrel roaring again; the future Hall of Famer has steadied the ship with eight scoreless outings after a very rocky start to May.\n\nWill Mariners' firing of hitting coordinator turn things around at the plate?\n\nIt was an odd weekend in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nSeattle swept the hapless Angels because, surprise, surprise, Mariners starting pitchers didn’t allow a single earned run across 20 innings. That’s how the Mariners do things. This rotation is downright dynamite, potentially historically good when it’s all done and dusted.\n\nBryan Woo, still on a strict pitch limit, carved on Friday. Bryce Miller, the gangly flame-throwing Texan, punched out nine Halos on Saturday. Luis Castillo, ol’ reliable, shoved seven scoreless on Sunday. Ho-hum stuff for the M’s.\n\nAs good as Seattle has been on the bump, they’ve been that horrendous in the batters box. The AL West’s horrendous-ness has shrouded the Mariners’ offensive ineptitude, but boy, oh, boy is this team hard to watch hit. The Mariners' struggles culminated in the firing of team “offensive coordinator” Brant Brown on Friday afternoon.\n\nBrown was brought in over the offseason to help the Mariners ditch the strikeout and increase contact. But through two months the club is hitting .223, which isn’t something good teams do.\n\nIt’s rare to see a first-year coach get the heave-ho after just two months, so keep an eye on Seattle’s offense to see if there is a meaningful change.\n\nTigers split with Red Sox, send No. 1 draft pick Spencer Torkelson down to Triple-A\n\nDetroit has been treading water of late in a surprisingly competitive AL Central. Kansas City and Cleveland have been spectacular, while Minnesota’s roller-coaster season is back on the upswing. But the Tigers, now a game under .500 after a four-game split at Fenway, have been the epitome of meh. Not good, not awful, just plain old mediocre.\n\nAnd while there were some definite positives — Jack Flaherty was again sensational and leadoff man Matt Vierling is on fire — Detroit made a significant transaction Sunday that showed things are far from peachy in the Motor City. Spencer Torkelson, the first overall pick in the 2020 MLB Draft and the presumed savior of Tiger baseball, was optioned down to Triple-A after starting the season with an ugly .597 OPS.\n\nThe Tigers hope a reset down in the minor leagues can fix Spencer Torkelson. (Eric Canha/USA TODAY Sports)\n\nDetroit’s rebuild, like any other, is dependent on the blossoming of stars. Its only obvious success in that regard has been the ascension of starting pitcher Tarik Skubal.\n\nTorkelson was supposed to be that for Detroit’s lineup and his demotion to the minor leagues is an admission that the big first baseman needs a reset. It’s hard to be the face of a franchise in Toledo.",

            "summary": "SAN FRANCISCO — Before Juan Soto could deliver the big swing, he needed Gleyber Torres and Jose Trevino to do the small things to help make sure the ninth inning got to him.\n\nWith Soto due up fourth, Torres roped a leadoff single against Giants closer Camilo Doval before Trevino busted it down the line to prevent a double play, flipping the lineup over on the way to a comeback 7-5 win on Sunday afternoon at Oracle Park.\n\nAnthony Volpe followed with an RBI triple — on which Trevino had to break out the wheels again, scoring all the way from first “in the fastest gear that I have,” he said — before Soto put the Yankees ahead with a two-run shot.\n\nJose Trevino’s hustle helped set up the Yankees’ ninth-inning rally. USA TODAY Sports\n\n“Obviously I know who’s hitting behind me and I know how important it is for those guys to get up to the plate,” Trevino said. “It’s just effort and playing for the guys in this clubhouse, plain and simple.”\n\nThe Yankees had been quiet in the late innings Sunday until the ninth, when Torres sparked the rally with a single up the middle off Doval that manager Aaron Boone said “you could feel” in the dugout. Trevino followed with his hustle to send the Yankees on their way.\n\n“It’s little things like that that might get overlooked, but we all see it and it leads to a big inning,” Aaron Judge said.\n\nJasson Dominguez’s rehab assignment reached its maximum of 20 days on Sunday, meaning the Yankees will have to make a move on his next step, which is expected to mean optioning him to Triple-A.\n\nDominguez’s rehab from Tommy John surgery has gone well, but he has only played three games in the outfield (the rest have been as DH) and there is no spot for him to get regular playing time on the Yankees’ current roster.\n\nIn 14 games through Sunday (between Single-A Tampa and Double-A Somerset), Dominguez was batting .333 (17-for-51) with four home runs on his rehab assignment.\n\nArt Shallock, the oldest living retired major leaguer and former Yankees left-hander, spent time chatting with Boone and players in the dugout Sunday morning.\n\nThe Yankees had honored Schallock when he turned 100 in April, sending him a jersey signed by the team.\n\n“Walking into Yankee Stadium — that was the greatest thrill for me,” Schallock said.\n\nSchallock played for the Yankees from 1951-55 and won a pair of World Series. He was roommates with Yogi Berra as a rookie, played with Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle and remembered Ted Williams as the toughest hitter he faced — though he noted that Williams never got a hit off him. How did he get the Hall of Famer out?\n\n“Junk,” Schallock said with a chuckle.\n\nOn Lou Gehrig Day — with all teams wearing a No. 4 decal on their jerseys — Boone was optimistic about how ALS awareness has taken off in the past few years.\n\n“I do feel like we’ve done a better job in our world but certainly as a sport of shining a light on a disease that’s named after one of the all-time greats in our sport,” Boone said. “Hopefully we can continue to do that. Hopefully we can continue to move the needle towards ultimately finding a cure. But an awful disease and I’m glad we’re able to bring attention to it, especially in our sport.”",

            "summary": "Folks who are expecting to see a dazzling parade of planets on Monday June 3 may be disappointed by what they end up seeing in the sky and, instead, experts are saying they should manage their expectations and wait until the end of the month to see the planetary alignment.\n\nThe past couple of months have been pretty eventful for backyard astronomers. First, the solar eclipse in April, then the northern lights made a rare appearance in May, and now a parade of planets will make its 2024 debut.\n\nStargazers are supposed to be able to see six planets, Jupiter, Mercury, Uranus, Mars, Neptune and Saturn, aligned.\n\nHowever, experts from NASA and Astronomers Without Borders both agree that it won't be the best time to see the planetary parade. That's because Uranus, Mercury and Jupiter will be swallowed up by the sun's light and be too close to the horizon to be visible.\n\nNorthern lights:Northern lights in US were dim compared to 'last time mother nature showed off': What to know\n\nExperts say be patient: Planet parade will be more of a show later in June\n\n\"To me, the closest thing to a planet parade is June 29th, when you’ll have Saturn, the third-quarter Moon, Mars, and Jupiter arrayed across the sky at dawn,\" Preston Dyches, a public engagement specialist for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory told USA TODAY. Dyches has a background in astronomy and hosts NASA's \"What's Up,\" a monthly video series that describes what's happening in the night sky.\n\nAndrew Fazekas, the communications manager for Astronomers Without Borders, says that when it comes to the planetary parade on June 3, it will be nearly impossible to see all the planets with the naked eye.\n\nBoth Fazekas and Dyches agree that it's better to see the planetary parade on June 29, instead.\n\nOn June 3, Jupiter, Mercury and Uranus are going to be \"way too close to the sun,\" said Fazekas. So, it will be difficult to see those three planets.\n\nSo, folks who do decide to rise before the sun does on Monday morning just to get a glimpse at this celestial phenomenon could be setting themselves up for disappointment.\n\nIn this case, good things come to those who wait. And waiting until the end of the month will give stargazers a better chance at viewing the planets.\n\n\"If you're patient and you wait until the end of the month, these planets will move farther away from the sun higher up in the early morning sky,\" Fazekas told USA TODAY \"So, that you will get an easier chance to pick them out in the sky.\n\nFolks will not only get a better view of the planetary parade if they wait until June 29, but they'll be able to gaze at the stars on Friday night into Saturday morning, instead of having to view it during the work week like they would this Monday morning.\n\nExcitement from solar eclipse, northern lights creating planet parade hype\n\nPeople are expecting to see something amazing the morning of June 3, said Fazekas. But, he's worried the expectations set by two very viral celestial events, the solar eclipse and northern lights, and sensationalization on social media could raise people's expectations a bit too high and lead to a lackluster experience.\n\nHe adds that he's concerned one bad experience that was overhyped online could steal people's enthusiasm about astronomy.\n\n\"What worries me is that we set people up for disappointment,\" said Fazekas \"And then they won't want to do it again.\"\n\nAccording to Fazekas, he's never seen so many people interested in sky-watching, and he doesn't want the excitement to end.\n\nWhat will you be able to see?\n\nAccording to a program called SkySafari Pro, you will be able to see the following during the planetary parade on June 29:\n\nJupiter, which will be closest to the horizon.\n\nUranus.\n\nMars.\n\nThe moon.\n\nNeptune.\n\nSaturn.\n\nWhat is a planetary parade?\n\nBasically, it's when the planets form a straight line and look like they're marching across the night sky and form a sort of space parade.\n\nIt's also known as a large planetary alignment, states Delaware Online, a part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nWhat equipment do you need to view a planetary parade?\n\nAccording to Fazekas, you will still need binoculars and telescopes to see some of the planets.\n\n\"Neptune is a planet that you need strong binoculars or a small telescope to be able to see,\" said Fazekas. \"And it's not easy to find either.\"\n\nFolks who go out to stargaze on June 28, will be able to see Neptune right next to the moon. On June 29, it will be farther away from the moon, and be above it instead.\n\nApps, like Skyview on the Apple app store, can turn people's phones into a tool that helps them identify celestial bodies in the night sky.\n\nWhere will you be able to see the planetary parade?\n\nAccording to Fazekas, people will need to do the following to get a view of the planetary parade:",

            "summary": "Hoosiers who wake up early Monday morning might catch a \"parade of planets,\" as some have dubbed it — an alignment of six planets happening in the predawn hours of June 3.\n\nWhile that's exciting news, avid skywatchers might need to curb their enthusiasm. Most of these planets won't be visible in the U.S., according to NASA, which said the next closest thing to a \"planetary parade\" isn't happening until much later.\n\nHere's what we know about it and other celestial events in June.\n\nWhat six planets will align June 3, 2024?\n\nThe alignment June 3 will consist of Mercury, Jupiter, Uranus, Mars, Neptune and Saturn. Experts say most of those planets will be hidden from view, however.\n\nNASA debunks visibility of 'planet parade'\n\nAs part of its annual monthly skywatching tips, NASA included a note debunking notions that the parade of planets would be easy to watch.\n\n\"Some online sources have shared excitement about a 'parade of planets' visible in the morning sky in early June (June 3 in particular). In reality, only two of the six planets supposedly on display — Saturn and Mars — will actually be visible,\" according to a statement from NASA, adding that Jupiter and Mercury won't likely be visible because they'll be at or below the horizon in morning twilight.\n\nAnd without a telescope, Uranus and Neptune are far too faint for the naked eye to see, NASA said, especially as the morning sky brightens.\n\nWhat planets can I see aligned in Indiana on June 3?\n\nThe planetary alignment will be visible across the Northern Hemisphere toward the eastern sky, weather permitting, but have a pair of binoculars with you, suggested Butler University Physics & Astronomy professor Brian Murphy.\n\n\"With a clear northeast horizon, and perhaps a pair of binoculars, one should be able to pick out Jupiter and Mercury,\" Murphy said in a message to IndyStar. \"The Moon, Mars and Saturn should be no issue since they appear far from the Sun in the sky. In fact, they can be seen well before sunrise.\"\n\nVenus, however, and many other planets in alignment, will be nearly impossible to spot because of their proximity to the sun, Murphy said.\n\nWhat time do the planets align?\n\nThe alignment happens June 3, 2024, just before dawn. Murphy said the best time to watch the skies will be 15-30 minutes ahead of sunrise.\n\n'Too outside-y.'Read the most absurd 1-star reviews of Indiana state parks in time for summer\n\nWhat's the weather forecast for Central Indiana on June 3?\n\nAs of Friday, according to the National Weather Service for Central Indiana, Sunday night will be partly cloudy, with a low around 62. Monday will have mostly sunny skies with a high near 85, south winds of 3 to 8 mph and a 30% chance of showers and thunderstorms after 2 p.m.\n\nDo you need a telescope or binoculars to see the planets?\n\nAt the very least, experts say you'll need high-powered binoculars to view the majority of the planets — Mercury and Jupiter will be extremely low in the sky. Uranus will be fairly dim and Neptune will appear star-like with binoculars due to its distance from Earth. But Mars and Saturn should be visible to the naked eye.\n\nNASA says another 'planet parade' is happening in late June\n\nThe closest thing to another \"planet parade,\" says NASA, will happen June 29, 2024, when Saturn, the Moon, Mars, and Jupiter will line up across the morning sky.\n\nHow do planetary alignments happen?\n\nThe planets in our solar system orbit the sun continuously. Over time, they slowly catch up to each other while traveling along the same path, the ecliptic. From our perspective on Earth, they sometimes appear to be aligned, according to NASA. However, the alignment formation will be short-lived since each planet moves at different speeds, depending on its distance from the sun.\n\nHow rare are planetary alignments?\n\nPlanet alignments are not extremely rare, especially with two to four planets. They occur several times each year. With five or more planets aligning, it's less common. The last planetary alignment seen in the Northern Hemisphere happened on April 8.\n\nHere's a quick look at the planets aligning on June 3.\n\nAstronomical events happening in June\n\nSkywatchers, according to NASA, should keep the following dates in mind for June 2024.\n\n◾ June 3: The crescent Moon sits beneath Mars in morning twilight. Look for them low in the eastern sky.\n\n◾ June 6: New moon.\n\n◾ June 21: Full moon.\n\n◾ June 24: Jupiter is now visible low in the east before sunrise. Look for the bright planet around 10 degrees above the horizon this final week of June, forming a line with Mars and Saturn that stretches toward the south.\n\n◾ June 27: Look for the Moon rising in the east with Saturn around midnight. By dawn this morning, you'll find them high in the southern sky. They appear super close together – close enough to appear in the same field of view through binoculars.\n\nOthers are reading:Here's when every full moon shines in 2024\n\nJohn Tufts covers trending news for the Indianapolis Star.

            "summary": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nA “planet parade” during which six planets will appear to align in the sky near dawn is on the way, but only three planets will be visible with the naked eye — and the phenomenon is more common than it sounds.\n\n“You’ll be able to see Mars, Saturn and Jupiter,” said Dr. James O’Donoghue, a planetary astronomer and research fellow at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. “If you have binoculars and if you know where to look, you could probably see Uranus, but there’s not much point in waiting until nearly sunrise — you might as well do that earlier in the night. Bottom line is that you can only see about half the planets in this planetary lineup with a naked eye.”\n\nThe best day to see the spectacle in Europe and North America will be Sunday, about half an hour before sunrise, according to O’Donoghue. Aiming for that time frame would give you a chance to spot Mercury as well, although it might not be easy even with binoculars, he said.\n\n“The problem is that the sun will be illuminating the sky in that area,” O’Donoghue added. “It’s just before the sunrise, but it will still be very, very bright in the sky, and you probably don’t want to be pointing your binoculars near the sun either.”\n\nIf you have one, a telescope would help, especially if you’re hoping to spot Uranus and Neptune. “But to actually be able to see these, you need to be zooming in to one target so much that you’re not seeing the others anyway, so you’d be getting rid of all your field of view,” he said.\n\nThe order in which the planets will align on Sunday is Jupiter, Mercury, Uranus, Mars, Neptune and Saturn, and they will be accompanied by a crescent moon. Later in the week, by Thursday, the moon will be out of the way — reducing light pollution, O’Donoghue noted — and Mercury will have switched positions with Jupiter.\n\nThe alignment will be visible to sky-watchers everywhere, but the ideal date to see the planets with the closest alignment might differ depending on where you are in the world.\n\nPlanetary alignments: What to know\n\nIt’s important to note that this alignment is not happening in space, but just in the sky as seen from our planet.\n\n“From the point of view of someone standing on the Earth, looking at the sky, it will look like there is more or less a straight line of planets, which you could call a planetary alignment or a planetary parade,” said Dr. Kate Pattle, a lecturer at the department of physics and astronomy of the University College London.\n\n“But physically, there’s no actual alignment happening. It’s just that most of the planets are more or less on the same side of the sun at the moment. If the planets actually aligned with each other in space, that would be called a syzygy and that’s a much, much rarer event,” she added.\n\nThis kind of planetary alignment is in fact not rare at all. “There’s going to be several more in the next couple of years, because the outer planets move in the sky more slowly, as they’re further away from us, creating lots of chances for these kinds of alignments to happen,” Pattle said. “Actually, a probably better one is going to happen next February, when we’ll have all of the planets in the sky at the same time, including Venus which is missing from this one.”\n\nPattle recommends Monday, about an hour before sunrise, as the best chance to see the show in most parts of the world, and she is more optimistic about Mercury joining the group of planets visible without instruments.\n\n“Mercury is usually visible with the naked eye if you’re somewhere with low light pollution, but it’s better with binoculars because (the planet is) not particularly bright and it’s only visible shortly before dawn, so it’s usually on a fairly bright background,” she said.\n\nAn app such as Stellarium Mobile or Night Sky can come in handy if you’re unsure where to look, and ideally you’ll need to be somewhere with low light pollution and a low horizon, because Jupiter, Mercury and Uranus are not going to be very far above it, Pattle said.\n\nYou should also try to be somewhere with a good view to the east, because this will be more or less in the direction of the sunrise. “Jupiter will be the easiest to spot, because it’ll be the brightest thing in the sky after the moon,” Pattle said. “The other planets, they’re not easy to distinguish, but they don’t twinkle in the same way that stars do, so that’s one way to spot them.”",

            "title": "Jacob Kmatz carries Oregon State baseball to win over UC Irvine in Corvallis Regional, waves goodbye to playoff pain",
            "summary": "CORVALLIS — It was right about this time last year, in the winners’ bracket of the Baton Rouge Regional, when the Oregon State baseball team suffered its first postseason defeat to all but sabotage its Omaha dreams.\n\nAnd Jacob Kmatz watched it all unfold from his couch in Corvallis, sporting a wounded wing and a battered psyche.\n\n“It wasn’t easy,” Kmatz said in February. “Especially not being there with the guys. But I think all of us have felt that pain from last year, whether we were there or not, and so it’s feeding into this year and our motivation and what we’re trying to achieve.”\n\nThe Beavers’ right-hander officially put that pain in the past Saturday night at Goss Stadium, where he tossed one of the best games of his career on one of the biggest stages of his career, lifting Oregon State to a 5-3 victory over the UC Irvine Anteaters in the winners’ bracket of the Corvallis Regional.\n\nThe top-seeded Beavers (44-14) advanced to the regional final, where they will play the winner between No. 2 seed UC Irvine (44-13) and No. 3 seed Tulane at 6 p.m. on Sunday (weather permitting).\n\nGolden Spikes Award semifinalist Travis Bazzana belted a monster two-run home run, Dallas Macias smacked the biggest hit of his career — a two-out, two-strike, two-run single — Elijah Hainline had a three-hit night and scored two runs and Bridger Holmes recorded his biggest save of the season. But it was Kmatz and his masterful start that nudged the Beavers to the doorstep of the super regionals.\n\n“Jacob Kmatz was really good,” Anteaters coach Ben Orloff said. “He looked like a frontline Pac-12 guy that started 45 games in his career. I thought he threw the ball really well.”\n\nFrom his first pitch to his last, Kmatz was exceptional, overpowering one of college baseball’s best lineups like few others have this season. He started hot, striking out the first five batters he faced, and closed strong, retiring the final six batters he faced. In between, the Anteaters — who entered the game ranked eighth in the nation in batting average and ninth in runs scored — had no answer.\n\nKmatz didn’t allow a base runner until the third inning, and it came on an OSU throwing error. He didn’t allow a hit until the fourth. And he didn’t allow a run until the fifth, when he gave up back-to-back two-out doubles. The 6-foot-3 junior went on to toss seven electric innings, during which he recorded nine strikeouts, allowed just one run, and surrendered three hits and a walk.\n\nHe worked ahead in counts, tossing first-pitch strikes to 18 of the 26 hitters he faced, and when he did go deep on hitters, he bucked up, striking out four of the five batters who worked him for full counts.\n\nBut it was those five strikeouts to open the game that first caused Goss to buzz.\n\n“You want to set the tone,” Kmatz said. “That’s a big part of it. We had a big win yesterday and … you’re just thinking about that first pitch and executing that first one and then you go from there. So just bringing energy and wanting to provide the guys with energy.”\n\nIt was completely different than the energy Kmatz carried this time last year, when he was sidelined with a sprained elbow just before the postseason. It was a personal nightmare watching the Beavers lose from his couch, and as he spent the summer resting and rehabilitating, Kmatz couldn’t help but imagine the day he could put that nightmare behind him.\n\n“It feels awesome to be out there in that environment again,” Kmatz said. “You watch it on TV from the couch and you put yourself in that position. Just feeling it and being in that moment, you’re present with it, and those are the moments you work for every day.”\n\nAs for the Beavers’ offense, well, it produced all it would need with two memorable swings. The first came in the bottom of the third, when Bazzana annihilated a two-run homer down the right field line. He was so out in front of the 3-2 pitch, he thought he hooked it foul. So Bazzana dipped his head, stepped away from the plate toward the visiting dugout, and started to clear his head for the next pitch.\n\nBut he was startled out of his daze by a stunner: The ball soared high and deep — and fair — over the right field fence, staying just inside the foul pole. It left the stadium before Bazzana even left the plate.\n\nWhen he realized what had happened, Bazzana screamed and flexed and bolted toward first base, then did it again as he rounded third, unleashing a torrent of emotion after staking the Beavers a 2-0 lead.\n\n“Playoff atmosphere, two-run shot … and the surprise of (the ball) coming back fair led to a little emotion,” said Bazzana, who belted his 28th homer of the season. “I think Jacob was just setting the tone with his energy and the way he was attacking hitters. So for us on offense to step up and kind of have the same energy as him; it was just the time and place to bring it.”\n\nThe other big Beavers swing came in fifth, when Macias stepped to the plate with the bases loaded. The sophomore outfielder quickly got down 1-2 in the count when Anteaters starter Trevor Hansen tried to sneak a pitch by him on the inside part of the plate. Macias turned on it and ripped a sharp single through the hole to right field, scoring Hainline and Mason Guerra to give the Beavers a 4-1 lead.\n\nIt was all the cushion they would need. After veteran right-hander Joey Mundt coughed up two runs in the eighth, Holmes retired the final two outs of the inning and then pitched a scoreless ninth, closing the door on his 13th save of the season.\n\nIt pushed the Beavers to the doorstep of the super regionals — and preserved a special outing for Kmatz (7-2). He ended his memorable night with a strikeout, after which he unleashed a fist pump and a scream toward the night sky, as 4,224 at Goss delivered a standing ovation.\n\n“Kmatz threw the heck out of the ball tonight,” Beavers coach Mitch Canham said. “He just kept getting better and better. As I was telling Jacob … being in the dugout, you live through the guys on the field a little bit. You can really feel their emotion … that emotion came out of Jacob tonight. It made (me) really feel that special moment, the fire that’s in them right now.”\n\n— Joe Freeman | jfreeman@oregonian.com | 503-294-5183 | @BlazerFreeman | Subscribe to The Oregonian/OregonLive newsletters and podcasts for the latest news and top stories.",

            "summary": "Brady Kasper\n\nPostseason baseball is back in Goss, as Oregon State has earned the #15 overall national seed and are hosting their fifth regional in the last seven seasons. Joining the Beavers in Corvallis are the UC Irvine Anteaters, Nicholls Colonels and Tulane Green Wave. Oregon State is matched up with the Lexington regional and should the Beavers win this regional they will play the winner of that one.\n\nAfter a sloppy second inning in game one against Tulane where they allowed three runs, the Beavers bounced back to dominate in a 10-4 win. Mason Guerra got the party started in the bottom of the second for Oregon State with a 2-RBI double to cut the Green Wave lead to one run. The game would remain 5-2 until the bottom of the fifth where Gavin Turley came through with his fifth grand slam of the season to left field that gave OSU a 6-3 lead. Tulane would get one back on a solo home run before Micah McDowell stretched the Beaver lead to four with a 2-RBI single. Trent Caraway provided OSU with an insurance run with an RBI knock before Travis Bazzana launched a mammoth shot to dead center that gave OSU a 10-4 lead. McDowell had four hits for the Beavers, while Bazzana, Caraway and Dallas Macias each had two. Aiden May was solid for OSU on the mound, going 5 and ⅔ innings allowing five hits and four runs while also striking out nine. Nelson Keljo had another fantastic outing out of the pen holding Tulane to one hit in 2 and ⅔ innings to go with four strikeouts. Bridger Holmes went on with one out in the ninth and struck out the two remaining batters to seal the deal for the Beavers.\n\nIn a crucial game two, Oregon State got a great performance from the pitching staff to take a 5-3 win over UC Irvine. Travis Bazzana opened the scoring for Oregon State in the bottom of the third inning with a moonshot to right field that just stayed a fair ball, scoring two runs for the Beavers. The Anteaters would get one as Dallas Macias couldn't quite come up with a diving catch and a run came across on an RBI double for Woody Hadeen. Macias would later come up clutch with bases loaded single, scoring two runs and giving OSU a 4-1 cushion. Brady Kasper would extend the lead to four with a bases loaded double play. OSU would run into some trouble in the eighth after pulling starter Jacob Kmatz, as a Caden Kendle double and Anthony Martinez sacrifice fly off of Joey Mundt cut the Beaver advantage to two. Bridger Holmes however would come to get the Beavers out of the jam and then retire the side with a pair of nasty strikeouts to seal the win for Oregon State. Elijah Hainline paced the Beavers offensively with three hits, including a triple, and two runs scored. Kmatz was locked in for the Beavers and went seven strong innings, allowing only three hits and one run while issuing a single walk and striking out nine Anteaters. Kmatz picked up his seventh win of the season, while Holmes moved into the top-5 of OSU's single season saves with his 13th of the '24 campaign.\n\nStick with BeaverBlitz tonight as the Beavers look to get past UC Irvine and advance to a super regional.",

            "summary": "Here is what drivers had to say after Sunday’s NASCAR Cup race at World Wide Technology Raceway:\n\nAustin Cindric — Winner: “Honestly, I’m heartbroken for the 12 team. I don’t know what happened to them at the end of the race, but they deserved to win this race. Ryan has been a hell of a leader on this team. This weekend was a great weekend for everybody involved. To have two cars in the fight and an eventual one-two there, like I said, I’m heartbroken for those guys, but this is huge for me. This is huge for this team. I’m so glad I was able to get a win with Brian as my crew chief in the Cup Series. You never know when it’s gonna happen again. I just drove my butt off and hoped for the best.”\n\nDenny Hamlin — Finished 2nd: “We had a top-five car – we didn’t have the best today, but the Yahoo Camry was in the mix, and was able to capitalize on some others misfortune there. We were going to have a top-five day regardless but proud of the team. They did a great job on pit road – Chris (Gabehart, crew chief) and the team brought a great car, just wasn’t quite enough.”\n\nBrad Keselowski — Finished 3rd: “That was strategy. We got behind early for sure, but we kept putting ourselves in position to keep moving forward and I wish I could have gotten second but it was a really hard-fought day for everyone on the Solomon Plumbing Ford Mustang. We will take a lot of good momentum from this one for sure.”\n\nTyler Reddick — Finished 4th: “A rough first stop there. I slid a little long, and just slowed everyone down on the 45 pit crew. We came in eighth and came out in 28th. It took the entire race to claw back from that – just a great effort by the guys. I feel like we were right there with (Austin Cindric) to start the race, so obviously, it is a little bit of a bummer that we had that issue, but that is kind of the name of the game when you come to World Wide Technology Raceway – you have to have a clean race, and unfortunately, we didn’t.”\n\nJoey Logano — Finished 5th: “We weren’t too far off. We were just a few adjustments away of getting our Shell/Pennzoil Mustang as good as our teammates were, but not too bad. We were able to grab some points, which we need to do, and a Penske car got in Victory Lane, so you’ve got to be happy about that. Obviously, we’d rather it be us, but that momentum goes through the whole shop. It’s still a good day. We still scored a bunch of points today with stage points in both stages. A poor qualifying effort, which probably hurt us a little bit on tuning the car and just a little too loose off.”\n\nAustin Dillon — Finished 6th: “That was a huge run for this team. I didn’t expect it after practice, but the guys made some great adjustments and our No. 3 DOW / Rivers are Life Chevy, with Ducks Unlimited on the side of the car, was really solid all day long, even in traffic. It was just a solid day for the No. 3 Chevy team that we really needed.”\n\nChristopher Bell — Finished 7th: “I have no idea what happened. Some sort of motor issue. I’m surprised that I made it to the end. Glad we were able to salvage something out of it. You don’t get race cars like that very often. Whenever you do, you need to take advantage of it. Disappointing day.”\n\nCarson Hocevar — Finished 8th: “This No. 77 Zeigler Auto Group Chevy team did a really good job with everything all race long. We had a really slow stop at the beginning of the race with a lug nut coming off. That really put us behind. We knew we had a great Chevy, so we just did everything we could. We played strategy a little bit to make sure we were on the right end of it. We caught the caution right, but then after that, our car was really good. We ran as high of fourth and we were catching third. Our lights were off, so we were a little slow down pit road. That was probably the difference of getting a top-five finish or not. All-in-all, it was just a really good job by this No. 77 team.”\n\nJustin Haley — Finished 9th: “It was a really good race for the MotoRad 51 team. I’m really proud of the strategy that the Rick Ware Racing team brought. It was a fast competitive car, and we were able to stay with it all day and make positive adjustments. When the final stage started, we really started picking up speed and had a lot of pace in the car. We had some good strategy and ran out of fuel right there at the line, but still got a top-10 and now we’ve got solid momentum going to Sonoma.”\n\nKyle Larson — Finished 10th: “I’m super proud of this top-10 finish. After the spin, I wasn’t expecting that. The car kind of came to life. The No. 5 HendrickCars.com Chevy team did a good job on our strategy. We were on offense there the last 25 laps or so. It went as well as it could, given the circumstances. I’ll take it.”\n\nChase Briscoe — Finished 17th: “I’m not really sure what all happened. I know there were a lot of different strategies there and I don’t know what played out and how it played out. Our car was OK. It definitely seemed like we struggled a little more on the long run than some of the other people, and we were lacking overall grip. Kind of a worst-case scenario for us, how it all played out. But I thought we definitely made our car way better from yesterday. We’ll learn from that and go to Sonoma.”\n\nDaniel Hemric — Finished 18th: “I think we learned a lot collectively as a team today. Our Poppy Bank Chevy struggled early on, but (crew chief) Trent (Owens) kept plugging away and made great changes. We caught a lucky break during stage two, which gave us great track position to start the final stage. I’m proud of how much we improved throughout the day.”\n\nNoah Gragson — Finished 22nd: “We just struggled all weekend with the balance, and struggled with speed, struggled with take-off pace, struggled with long-run speed. Everything was just stuck in dirty air and couldn’t go on new tires, just struggled. Appreciate all these SERVPRO guys. Our 10 team, we’re frustrated, it’s not to our standard today. We’re going to go back to work and figure it out for Sonoma.”\n\nRyan Blaney — Finished 24th: “I never thought in my mind we were short. It’s one of those things. I’m proud of the 12 boys. The Menards/Richmond Ford was fast. I had my work cut out for me holding off Christopher. That was fun. I don’t know what happened to him, but just one lap short. That stinks, but congrats to the 2 team. They did a good job all day. Props to them, Austin. I’m proud for Team Penske and Ford. I’m really happy with our showing today. I don’t know what I’ve got to do to get some luck on our side. I’ve wrecked the last two points races and thought we had a great shot to win today and I ended up bad, so I just appreciate the effort. We just have to keep sticking with it.”\n\nDerek Kraus — Finished 30th: “It was a long day here at Gateway. I felt we had a better car than our results, however, I was never able to get the track position we needed or keep it when we did have it. I’m thankful for Kafka Conveyors and Kaulig Racing for the opportunity, and I look forward to having another shot towards the end of the year.”\n\nKyle Busch — Finished 35th: “It looked like he (Kyle Larson) got loose down the front straightaway into turn one. He was on older tires and trying to get us for a spot. I’m not sure what that single point would mean for him, but it certainly hurt us a lot. It took that point away, as well as the others that we would get for the stage and then also the rest of the day. It’s very frustrating. We can’t afford days like that. The No. 8 Rebel Bourbon Camaro wasn’t what it was last year, but it was a top-10 car and we were going to finish there. Now we’re not going to finish at all.”\n\nJosh Berry — Finished 36th: “I really don’t know what happened. Obviously, with what our past has been with the rotors here, it kind of makes you think that. I went over and looked at the rotors and it looked like they were still on it so it is either that or a tire. … We moved up into the top 15 pretty quickly. The car was pretty good and I was learning a lot. We pushed the exit on the last section a little too hard and got the penalty there. We were still passing cars though and it would have been another good day.”\n\n",

            "title": "Cindric claims victory in Enjoy Illinois 300 after Blaney slows on final lap",
            "summary": "MADISON, Ill. (AP) — Austin Cindric emerged as the surprise winner of the NASCAR Cup series race Sunday at World Wide Technology Raceway when teammate Ryan Blaney apparently ran out of gas while leading on the final lap.\n\nBlaney, the reigning NASCAR Cup series champion, appeared to be on his way to his first win of the season after fighting off a challenge from Christopher Bell, who had his own car trouble in the closing laps.\n\nCindric, who had pitted just one lap after Blaney, took advantage of the situation and notched his second career victory. The other came in the 2022 Daytona 500.\n\nDenny Hamlin came in second, recording his sixth straight top-5 finish. Brad Keselowski was third, followed by Tyler Reddick and Joey Logano.\n\nBell had been the dominant car for much of the day in suburban St. Louis, leading 80 of the 240 laps. The three Penske cars — Cindric, Blaney and Logano — did not pit in the break between the second and third stages, and that put them in position to go for the win.\n\nBlaney and Bell, the winner of last week’s rain-shortened Coca-Cola 600, dueled for the lead for several laps before Bell — just after finally squeezing ahead of Blaney briefly — let up and reported motor issues to his crew. Bell wound up seventh, getting a push by teammate Martin Truex Jr. on the straightaways in the final laps.\n\nBlaney settled for 24th, coasting around as the last finisher on the lead lap.\n\nMichael McDowell started on the pole and led the first 40 laps before Bell maneuvered his way inside to take the lead for the first time.\n\nKyle Busch, last year’s winner who struggled with grip in practice and qualifying on Saturday, pitted on lap 19 during an early caution and took the lead following the restart when other leaders pitted after Stage 1 concluded on lap 45.\n\nBut Bell quickly carved through the eight cars that hadn’t pitted and reclaimed the lead on the 69th lap.\n\nDEFENDING CHAMP CRASHES\n\nBusch and Kyle Larson were battling side-by-side for seventh on the final lap of Stage 2 when they got together in an incident that took the defending race champion out.\n\nAfter the two rubbed on the front stretch, Larson tried to dive inside Busch going into Turn 1, but he got loose in the process. Larson’s car slid up the track and forced Busch into the wall. Busch’s race was over, but Larson was able to pit and return to the race in 29th place.\n\n“Trying to race for a playoff spot and, you know, gradually falling there a little bit,” said Busch, who was the runner-up in the track’s inaugural Cup series race in 2022 before winning last year. “He got loose and wiped us out.”\n\nOn their radio communications, Larson and his spotter accused Busch of causing the crash by giving him no room on the inside.\n\nARMSTEAD GIVES BACK\n\nMiami Dolphins offensive tackle Terron Armstead, who is from nearby Cahokia, Illinois, brought 20 area kids to the race as part of his foundation’s growing efforts in the community.\n\nArmstead hosted his second annual charity basketball game Friday and his 10th annual football skills camp on Saturday\n\n“The overall goal for everything this weekend is really exposure and introduction to different industries, different paths, a lot of different walks of life, different sports, networking, meeting new people, connecting dots, relationship building,” said Armstead, who recently restructured his contract in hopes of helping the Dolphins win the Super Bowl.\n\n“That’s the goal — and for memories. Maybe spark a fire in the youth.”\n\nCorey LaJoie speeds away after a pit stop during a NASCAR Cup Series auto race at World Wide Technology Raceway Sunday, June 2, 2024, in Madison, Ill.

            "title": "Liberty limit Caitlin Clark to her worst WNBA game yet in rout of Fever",
            "summary": "Sandy Brondello felt that the Indiana Fever had started to figure everything out, that they had made strides in the two weeks since the teams last met. But it seems as if the Liberty have figured out Caitlin Clark and the Fever offense, too.\n\nIn their first meeting, Betnijah Laney-Hamilton held Clark to nine points and was a franchise-record plus-32. Two days later, Clark flashed her potential with a 10-point first quarter and 22 total. But Sunday, when the Liberty and Fever met for the third time in less than three weeks, Clark was nearly eliminated altogether.\n\n4 Sabrina Ionescu #20 of the New York Liberty and Caitlin Clark at Barclays Center on Sunday night. Michelle Farsi/New York Post\n\nShe finished with a career-low three points before getting dinged in the ear on a screen in the fourth quarter, briefly going back to the locker room and later returning to the bench in the Liberty’s 104-68 win. Laney-Hamilton and Kayla Thornton mostly split the task of guarding Clark, and that allowed the Liberty to secure their best start (7-2) since the league’s inaugural season in 1997. The game doubled as the Commissioner’s Cup opener.\n\n“The way Betnijah guards [Clark],” Sabrina Ionescu said, “I’m happy she’s on our team. But collectively as a team, we understand who kind of the head of the monster is on that team, and trying to just make everything tough and difficult.”\n\nLaney-Hamilton also led the Liberty with 20 points, while Jonquel Jones poured in 18 and snagged 13 rebounds. The Liberty shot 57 percent from the field and 44 percent from 3 in a sample that resembled the offense that propelled their run to the WNBA Finals last year.\n\n4 The Indiana Fever’s Caitlin Clark is defended by the Liberty’s Kayla Thornton in the Libs’ crushing win at Barclays Center. Michelle Farsi/New York Post\n\nClark’s lone basket came on a 3-pointer to start the second quarter, but that was it. She shot 1 of 10 from the field and 1 of 7 on 3s. Late in the first half, she tried to drive for a layup and was blocked from behind by Thornton. Then, Clark missed a transition layup with Ionescu chasing her down. And with Laney-Hamilton picking up on the ball, opponents — such as the Fever — can’t start their offense until 12 seconds remain on the shot clock, Ionescu said.\n\n“It’s more of a chess match,” Laney-Hamiltion said of guarding Clark, “but … because I’m always having to do it, I’m kind of always ready and prepared for that moment.”\n\n4 Breanna Stewart Michelle Farsi/New York Post\n\nInstead, Clark became a facilitator, dishing out five assists and watching as NaLyssa Smith and Kelsey Mitchell helped the Fever trim an 18-point halftime deficit to 12 in the third quarter, but that advantage quickly ballooned again. The Liberty even shifted Laney-Hamilton to Mitchell in the second half.\n\n“Hey, why not?” Brondello said. “That’s the luxury that we have.”\n\nThis all unfolded 30 hours after the Fever’s game against the Chicago Sky included a twist of controversy when Chennedy Carter shoved Clark to the ground. One day later, the league changed the call from a common foul to a flagrant I. Carter refused to answer questions about the hard foul Saturday and later wrote on Instagram that she’d “rather you hate me.”\n\n4 Sabrina Ionescu of the New York Liberty handles the ball during a game against the Fever on Sunday. Michelle Farsi/New York Post\n\nFever coach Christie Sides commended Clark for how she handled the situation, for how she asked the official to review it and didn’t try to respond otherwise. But the Fever struggled to channel the progress from what ended as a one-point win into anything that became a tangible threat to the Liberty’s third consecutive victory.\n\nLaney-Hamilton’s points, which tied her season-high, on 7-for-9 shooting continued an offensive emergence dating back to late in the 2023 campaign, once her role on the superteam — one different from her previous two years with the organization — came into focus and she became one of the Liberty’s most consistent scorers in the playoffs. They used her in isolation Sunday. They created scenarios where her back was to the basket, where Laney-Hamilton could weave and twist and weave again until finding just enough space.\n\nSo in plenty of ways, Sunday was déjà vu for the Liberty. It was déjà vu for the Fever — the latest reminder that it’ll take time for Clark to adjust — in their return to Brooklyn. There were still Clark signs and the No. 22 jerseys scattered throughout the crowd that’ll accompany them everywhere, but this time, the Liberty unveiled the most effective blueprint yet for containing her.",

It was the lowest point total and field goal rate (10%) in a game during both her time in the WNBA (11 games) and college (139 games at Iowa).\n\n\"I think collectively, as a team, we understand who kind of the head of the monster is on that team, and we are trying to just make everything tough and difficult,\" Liberty guard Sabrina Ionescu said of Clark. \"Obviously, they came off a back-to-back, so it's a little bit tough for them, as well. But she'll figure it out. It's not that big of a deal to have a game like that.\"\n\nBetnijah Laney-Hamilton scored 20 points, and Jonquel Jones added 18 for the Liberty, who were nearing the end of the easy win when Clark left the game. Clark, the No. 1 pick in April's draft, played the first few minutes of the fourth quarter before exiting, holding her ear for a bit as she left the court. She was hurt while getting bumped on a screen.\n\nClark was fine afterward.\n\nThe Fever had another scary moment a few minutes later when Aliyah Boston went down awkwardly with an ankle injury after she was fouled. She gingerly walked off the court and back to the locker room.\n\nIndiana coach Christie Sides didn't have an update on the extent of Boston's injury, but last season's Rookie of the Year seemed to be OK while walking around in front of the locker room.\n\nIndiana was playing the second game of a back-to-back set. The Fever (2-9) beat the Chicago Sky on Saturday by one point.\n\nThe Fever have had a brutal stretch to the start the season, with 11 games in the first 20 days, including playing New York three times now.\n\n\"Their legs were shot. I mean, that's where everything stems from, your legs, when you shoot the basketball -- especially for 3s,\" Sides said. \"They're shot, they're gassed, so everything was a little short.\"\n\nThe Liberty took advantage of the tired Fever, racing out to a 31-13 lead after one quarter. Laney-Hamilton and Breanna Stewart each had seven points in the opening 10 minutes as New York pushed the pace.\n\nClark was scoreless in the first quarter before starting off the second quarter with a logo 3-pointer. She was constantly hounded defensively by Laney-Hamilton and Kayla Thornton.\n\nClark did finish with five assists, and she has now led or co-led the Fever in assists in all 11 games this season, extending the second-longest such streak to start a career in WNBA history (Ticha Penicheiro, 26).\n\nNew York led 55-37 at the break. Indiana got within 12 early in the third quarter before the Liberty blew open the game.\n\nKelsey Mitchell scored 21 points to lead Indiana.\n\nInformation from ESPN Stats & Information and The Associated Press was used in this report.",

            "summary": "NEW YORK (AP) — Caitlin Clark had just one basket and three points in the worst game of her young pro career, and the New York Liberty routed the Indiana Fever 104-68 on Sunday night.\n\n“I think collectively as a team, we understand who kind of the head of the monster is on that team and we are trying to just make everything tough and difficult,” Liberty guard Sabrina Ionescu said. “Obviously, they came off a back-to-back, so it’s a little bit tough for them as well. But she’ll figure it out. It’s not that big of a deal to have a game like that.”\n\nBetnijah Laney-Hamilton scored 20 points and Jonquel Jones added 18 for the Liberty, who were nearing the end of the easy win when Clark left the game and Aliyah Boston departed a few minutes later after an awkward fall that injured her left ankle.\n\nClark shot 1 for 10 and had five assists. The No. 1 pick in the draft played the first few minutes of the fourth quarter before exiting, holding her left ear for a little bit as she left the court. She hurt it while getting bumped on a screen. Clark went to the locker room with Boston for a few minutes, but returned to the bench for the final 2 1/2 minutes of the game.\n\nClark was fine afterward.\n\nIndiana coach Christie Sides didn’t have an update on the extent of Boston’s injury, but last season’s Rookie of the Year seemed to be OK walking around in front of the locker room.\n\nThe Fever have had a brutal stretch to the start the season with 11 games in the first 20 days, including playing New York three times now.\n\n“Their legs were shot. I mean, that’s where everything stems from, your legs, when you shoot the basketball — especially for 3s,” Sides said. “They’re shot, they’re gassed, so everything was a little short.”\n\nIndiana was playing the second game of a back-to-back set. The Fever (2-9) beat Chicago on Saturday afternoon by one point.\n\nThe Liberty took advantage of the tired Fever, racing out to a 31-13 lead after one quarter. Laney-Hamilton and Breanna Stewart each had seven points in the opening 10 minutes as New York pushed the pace.\n\nClark was scoreless in the first quarter before starting off the second period with a logo 3-pointer. She was constantly hounded defensively by Laney-Hamilton and Kayla Thornton.\n\nNew York led 55-37 at the break. Indiana got within 12 early in the third quarter before the Liberty blew open the game.\n\nKelsey Mitchell scored 21 points to lead Indiana.\n\nBRINGING IN FANS\n\nClark has been a huge draw at home and on the road this season. New York had 17,401 fans in attendance for the game.\n\nUNSELFISH PLAY\n\nAll five Liberty starters had at least four assists as the team combined to have 30.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nFever: Indiana finally gets time to rest as its next game is Friday in Washington.\n\nLiberty: New York travels to Chicago for a rematch against the Sky, who handed the team its first loss of the season.\n\n___\n\nAP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",

            "summary": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nLANCASTER, Pa. -- As she stood on the 18th green at Lancaster Country Club late Sunday, clutching the Harton S. Semple Trophy for the second time in her young career, Yuka Saso paused, looked down and let the wave of emotion register.\n\n\"My family,\" she said tearfully, eventually speaking after the horde of onlookers gathered around the hole clapped and cheered encouragement, \"I wouldn't be here without their support.\"\n\nIt was fitting then that three years after gifting her mom with a U.S. Women's Open win, Saso, 22, could give a similar present to her father.\n\n\"It's just a wonderful feeling that I was able to give back to my parents in the same way,\" Saso said.\n\nTwo Good Yuka Saso became the youngest two-time champion in U.S. Women's Open history with her win Sunday at Lancaster Country Club. Age Years Yuka Saso 22-347 2021, 2024 Hollis Stacy 24-129 1977, 1978 Mickey Wright 24-133 1958, 1959 Inbee Park 24-343 2008, 2013 -- ESPN Stats & Information\n\nIn 2021, Saso became the first golfer from the Philippines -- the country of her mother's origin -- to win the U.S. Women's Open. Months later, while holding dual Philippine/Japanese citizenship, she decided to instead solely represent her father's native Japan and has been playing underneath that country's banner since.\n\nSaso's win puts her in position to compete for Japan at the Olympics later this summer. She represented the Philippines in the Tokyo Games in 2021.\n\nSunday's victory was also the first Saso has had in any tournament since her first U.S. Women's Open win. The long layoff between trophy presentations caused her to wonder if she ever would finish atop an event again.\n\n\"I definitely had a little doubt if I can win again,\" she said. \"It just makes it special because after a long wait -- I wasn't expecting to win the U.S. Women's Open. Every time, last time, too, I wasn't expecting it, and this time, too, I wasn't expecting it.\n\n\"I think that's why it made me a bit emotional.\"\n\nSaso won $2.4 million from the $12 million purse, the largest in women's golf and in women's sports at a stand-alone venue.\n\nAt 22 years, 347 days, she became the youngest two-time champion in Open history.\n\nThis time, her win was the byproduct of a furious charge up the leaderboard on the final day. She entered at 2 under overall, 3 shots off the lead.\n\nBy the end of the day, Saso stood alone, carding a 2-under 68 for a 3-shot win. On an afternoon that saw much of the top of the field collapse, Saso's win was all but decided before the final two groups came off the course.\n\nAs she buried a par putt on No. 18 to all but ice the victory, Saso gave a muted, left-armed fist pump, hugged caddie Dylan Vallequette, and casually walked off the course as several fans loudly chanted, \"Yu! Yu! Yu!\"\n\n\"I'm not sure how the other players played. I wasn't looking at the scoreboard,\" Saso said. \"I wasn't too relaxed to be able to see the scoreboard. I just tried to be focused on my routine and my game.\"\n\nWith Saso rattling off four back-nine birdies -- helping to negate a double bogey on No. 6 -- her competitors lost their respective grips on the lead.\n\nFirst, it was Wichanee Meechai. A co-leader entering Sunday at 5 under, Meechai was flat early, with bogeys on the first two holes and a double bogey on the par-3 sixth. Meechai's tee shot on No. 6 approached the pin firmly and at first looked like a potential birdie opportunity. But instead of sticking its landing, the ball slipped off one of the course's notoriously unforgiving greens and fell into a water hazard along the left side.\n\n\"It's the U.S. Open. The pins were so hard,\" Meechai said. \"Sometimes you can play bad golf on one day, but I'm kind of proud of myself that I can handle this week pretty good.\"\n\nMeechai finished tied for sixth; in three previous tries at the Open, she had never finished better than 30th.\n\nWhile Meechai was falling out of the lead, her fellow co-leaders entering the day also couldn't keep pace. Minjee Lee had a hellacious back nine, sandwiching a pair of bogeys with double bogeys on Nos. 12 and 14. She finished tied for ninth.\n\nAmerican Andrea Lee, 25, had a pair of costly bogeys on the final two holes to drop to even for the tournament and into a tie for third.\n\n\"I definitely learned a lot this week about myself,\" said Lee, who's from Southern California. \"I do belong out here, and I feel like I am good enough to win and be in contention for major championships. I just need to do better.\"\n\nAnother American, Ally Ewing, 31, had Sunday's best score, a 66. After opening the round 9 shots off the lead at 4 over, Ewing finished just 4 shots back.\n\n\"For any golfer, we want to peak around major championships,\" Ewing said. \"Starting the week with a 4 over and then just gradually playing the golf course better and better, executing more shots, it's just a really good feeling.\n\n\"This was where I made my first professional U.S. Open start, so really good memories for Lancaster now.\"\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report.",

            "summary": "On U.S. Women’s Open Sunday, full range of emotions on display\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare on Twitter\n\nShare by Email\n\nYuka Saso won her second U.S. Women's Open title in Lancaster — but there were plenty of players who left heartbroken. Getty Images\n\nLANCASTER, Pa. — As the final group came off the course on Sunday at the 79th U.S. Women’s Open, Minjee Lee and Andrea Lee (no relation) walked through a sea of fans gathered around the outside of the Lancaster Country Club clubhouse.\n\nMinjee walked first, staring blankly ahead, only breaking her trance to thank a fan who complimented her bright pink shirt. Andrea came next, stopping to hug Ruoning Yin before continuing on to the scoring area. Each had entered Sunday hoping to win the biggest event in women’s golf. They both came away empty-handed.\n\nAs the two Lees continued their march to the scoring tent, they passed by a collection of photographers, videographers and writers. The group was following Yuka Saso, whose two-under 68 had clinched her the second U.S. Women’s Open title of her career. She was headed to the 18th green to receive her prize — the Harton S. Semple trophy.\n\nMinjee walked by without a second glance, while Andrea stopped for a moment to take in the scene. If a few shots had happened differently, it could have been one of them commanding the attention of the hoard of media. Instead, they will each leave Lancaster ruing the what-ifs.\n\nAndrea met with the assembled media and voiced her disappointment in how she’d played. She was in contention right until the end, three untimely back-nine bogeys sinking her chances of winning the biggest tournament of her young career.\n\n“It was tough out there,” she said. “Obviously didn’t have my best right from the start. I was pretty nervous, but yeah, just didn’t have great shots out there.”\n\nComing up just short is never easy, but when it happens on Sunday, you’ve got to relive the heartache. When you come close to glory, but ultimately fail, everyone wants to know what went wrong. As Andrea spoke interviewed with Amy Rogers from the Golf Channel, tears welled in her eyes.\n\nNot far away, runner-up Hinako Shibuno spoke with the Japanese media contingent in her native tongue. The 2019 AIG Women’s Open champion has earned the nickname “Smiling Cinderella” for her megawatt smile that seemingly never leaves her face. This occasion was no different.\n\nAlthough Shibuno had also come up just short of the ultimate goal, there wasn’t the same hint of regret that followed the final pairing.\n\n“I have been very nervous all the way through,” Shibuno said. “I feel like there are some places that are a little bit regrettable, but still, I think I finished strong.”\n\nAs Shibuno played in the penultimate pairing, she watched on from the 18th fairway as Saso saved par on the final hole. As soon as the ball touched the bottom of the cup, she clapped her hands over her head in appreciation of the round her friend and competitor had put together.\n\nWhen Saso watched the ball roll into the cup, she too raised her hands in jubilation. Her final-round 68 — complete with a back-nine 32 — got her in the house at four under par. And with her nearest competitors faltering a few holes back, it was at this moment that her dreams of a second U.S. Women’s Open title became a reality. Saso insists she didn’t know where she stood on the leaderboard for most of the day, but when that par putt dropped, she knew exactly what it meant.\n\n“I wasn’t too relaxed to be able to see the scoreboard,” she said. “But like I said earlier, I just tried to be focused on my routine and my game, and I think that’s why I looked like that on TV. I think it’s a good thing that I looked like that.”\n\nWith her second Semple trophy in hand, and a little history in tow, Saso took a moment for an interview with Golf Channel on the 72nd green. Her father was alongside her for this victory, and as she spoke, tears came to her eyes.\n\n“I think winning in 2021 I represented the Philippines,” Saso said. “I feel like I was able to give back to my mom. This year I was able to represent Japan, and I think I was able to give back to my dad. I’m very happy that I was able to do it. It’s just a wonderful feeling that I was able to give back to my parents in the same way.”\n\nAs the crowds shuffled out of Lancaster Country Club, and the sun set over the hills in the distance, another major Sunday was complete. For Saso, the day ended with the highest of highs. For those who came oh so close to glory, this will be a Sunday they’d soon like to forget.\n\nNo matter the final result, the full range of emotions always comes out on the final day of a major. That much was clear on the final day of this U.S. Women’s Open.",

            "title": "Dallas Stars ousted in what might have been 'our best game'",
            "summary": "Stars coach Peter DeBoer describes his disappointment after the Stars were eliminated by the Edmonton Oilers in the Western Conference final. (1:08)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nWhen it came to what the Dallas Stars did in Game 6, captain Jamie Benn said it was likely his team's best performance of the Western Conference finals.\n\nIt was also the one that saw the Stars get eliminated in Game 6 of a West finals for the second year in a row.\n\nDespite taking three times the shots and owning the puck 75% of the time, the Stars fell short in a 2-1 loss Sunday to the Edmonton Oilers, who reached the Stanley Cup Final for the first time since 2006.\n\n\"You could probably argue that was our best game of the series,\" Benn said. \"It just didn't go our way.\"\n\nEntering Game 6, the goal for the Stars was to echo the comeback they mounted in the first round of the playoffs, when after falling to a two-game deficit against the defending Stanley Cup champion Vegas Golden Knights, Dallas ended up winning the series in seven games.\n\nThis time, the Stars grabbed a 2-1 series lead before the Oilers scored a combined eight goals in their Games 4 and 5 wins, giving them a chance to clinch in six. A Stars' victory Sunday would have forced a deciding game in Dallas, giving coach Peter DeBoer a chance to extend his record to 8-0 in Game 7s.\n\nInstead, the Stars' flight back to Dallas will start an offseason powered by the reality that they're still in a championship window.\n\n\"We went through a gauntlet and beat some really good teams and knew we had something special,\" Stars forward Tyler Seguin said. \"We lost to a team that we thought we could beat and sometimes, that's playoffs. Sometimes, it's that one bounce, that one goal, that one save. That's why we all love it. That's why it's the hardest damn trophy in the world to win.\"\n\nEdmonton had a 2-0 lead by the end of the first period after Connor McDavid deked his way to the net before firing a point-blank shot to beat Jake Oettinger, then Zach Hyman scored a power-play goal with a little more than three minutes left in the frame.\n\nNot only did the Oilers have a two-goal lead after the first, but they did it by mustering three only shots while the Stars had 12.\n\nThe Stars would finish with 35 shots, the Oilers with 10. Natural Stat Trick's metrics show that the Stars had a shot-share of 73.75% in 5-on-5 play while also racking up 10 high-danger scoring chances, something they hadn't done since Game 3.\n\nAnd they had three power-play chances, while the Oilers had just one opportunity with the extra-skater advantage.\n\nEven with their latest defeat, losing in the conference final for a second straight season strengthens the Stars' belief that they're in a championship window. The group has reached three West finals in the past five years for an organization that built its roster through the draft.\n\nBenn was among 10 players who were drafted by the Stars and played for them in Game 6. The team's younger talents include Jason Robertson, Roope Hintz, Wyatt Johnston, Thomas Harley, Oettinger and Mavrik Bourque, who made his playoff debut Sunday.\n\nThe 34-year-old Benn is one of 13 Stars players under contract for next season. Harley, as a restricted free agent, is among those who will remain under team control. Others, such as trade-deadline acquisition Chris Tanev, second-round series hero Matt Duchene and veteran forward Joe Pavelski, are unrestricted free agents.\n\n\"I believe that, yeah,\" Benn said of the Stars' setup for a strong future. \"But I'm not really thinking about it right now. This a tough time.\"\n\nSeguin, who is under contract for three more seasons, shared his reasons for optimism.\n\nHe said recent Stanley Cup champions have had to go through painful defeats before reaching their goal, noting that it took time for the Golden Knights and Tampa Bay Lightning to break through.\n\nAnother team he mentioned is the one the Oilers will face in the Stanley Cup Final: the Florida Panthers. They lost in the first round in 2019 and again in 2020 before reaching the second round in 2021 and losing, only to now be in a consecutive Cup Final for the first time in team history.\n\n\"Unfortunately, you got to lose a lot to win in this league,\" said Seguin, who won a Cup with the Boston Bruins in 2011. \"I don't know why it's like that. Learn some lessons, keep this taste and get ready for next year.\"",

            "title": "Stars ‘gutted’ after elimination in Game 6 of Western Final",
            "summary": "Defenseman Ryan Suter has played 1,444 regular-season games, most among active players who have not won the Cup, and 133 playoff games. He’s 39 with one season left on his contract. Before the series, he sat next to Pavelski at a press conference and was asked about chasing the Cup.\n\n“I can’t speak for Joe, but for myself, it’s the only reason I’m playing,” said Suter, who has four kids, ages 6-13. “My kids are at the age now where I want to spend more time with them and be a part of what they’re doing, whether it’s hockey or other sports or school or whatever. But for me, that’s the reason I’m playing.\n\n“You hear so many good stories …”\n\nHis voice trailed off.\n\n“And it’s not going to define your career,” he continued. “If you don’t [win the Cup], obviously, it would [stink], but I don’t think it defines you as a player. But that’s why I’m playing.”\n\nCaptain Jamie Benn has played 1,112 regular-season and 102 playoff games, all with the Stars, without winning the Cup. He turns 35 on July 18 and has one season left on his contract.\n\nForward Matt Duchene, 33, has played 1,056 regular-season and 51 playoff games without winning the Cup. He signed a one-year contract with the Stars on July 1, mostly because he thought they gave him the best chance to win.\n\n“You want to win, but you really want to win for those older guys,” said Stars center Wyatt Johnston, a 21-year-old who lived at Pavelski’s house the past two seasons. “Yeah, it [stinks]. You want to win so bad and you want those older guys to get their Cup.”\n\nThe Stars believed they could do it. They went 52-21-9 in the regular season, winning the Western Conference and finishing one point behind the New York Rangers for the Presidents’ Trophy. They defeated the past two Stanley Cup champions: the Vegas Golden Knights (2023) in seven games in the first round and the Colorado Avalanche (2022) in six in the second.\n\nBut in the conference final, they let a couple of opportunities slip away. In Game 1, they failed to cash in on a double minor in overtime -- forward Jason Robertson hit the right goal post and then the left -- and lost 3-2 in double OT. They took a 2-0 lead in the first period of Game 4 and had a chance to take a 3-1 lead in the best-of-7 series, but they were outscored 10-2 the rest of the way.\n\nSpecial teams were a big factor. The Stars went 0-for-14 on the power play. The Oilers went 4-for-11, including 2-for-3 in Game 5 and 2-for-2 in Game 6.\n\nAfter the Oilers took a 2-0 lead in the first period of Game 6, they sat back, and the Stars carried the play. Forward Mason Marchment cut it to 2-1 at 9:18 of the third period. But despite a desperate push to the final horn, despite outshooting the Oilers 35-10, the Stars couldn’t get the tying goal.\n\nGutted. As the teams lined up for handshakes, the Stars had to hear the Edmonton fans cheering and chanting, “We want the Cup!”\n\n“Hockey’s hard, you know?” forward Tyler Seguin said. “You need a lot of things to go right. You need to have that opportunity. We had that opportunity. We went through a gauntlet, beat some really good teams and knew we had something special and lost to a team that we thought we could beat, and sometimes that’s playoffs. Sometimes it’s that one bounce, that one goal, one save.\n\n“It’s why we all love it. It’s why this is the hardest [dang] trophy in the world to win.”",

            "summary": "EDMONTON — Tyler Seguin’s voice caught. Wyatt Johnston’s eyes watered. Pete DeBoer’s face sank.\n\nComing this close to the Stanley Cup Final and coming up short was excruciating. Feeling like they had failed Joe Pavelski was somehow worse.\n\n“Don’t ask about Joe,” Seguin said with a sad laugh as he welled up a bit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Sunday night’s 2-1 loss to the Edmonton Oilers in Game 6 of the Western Conference final was the last game of Pavelski’s career — and it sure sounded like a real possibility based on the way his teammates spoke of him afterward — it’ll be a tough one to swallow. Pavelski had a postseason to forget, with just one goal and three assists in 19 games. The man with 1,068 career regular-season points and 143 more in the playoffs didn’t register a single one in the Oilers series.\n\nBut his impact on the Stars these last five seasons was immeasurable.\n\n“Since Day 1, since he’s been in here, he’s meant everything to our group — on the ice, off the ice, all our golf games,” Seguin said. “He’s improved all of those. Just an amazing person to have in here.”\n\nDeBoer called it “the absolute privilege of my coaching career to coach a guy like that.” Captain Jamie Benn called him an “all-time teammate.” And Johnston, who at 21 years old is barely half Pavelski’s age (the veteran turns 40 next month), was in tears when discussing the man whose family he’s lived with since entering the NHL.\n\n“I can’t thank him and his family enough for what they’ve done for me,” Johnston said.\n\nJoe Pavelski didn’t register a single point in the Stars’ playoffs series vs. the Oilers. (Leila Devlin / Getty Images)\n\nIt was another near-miss in a career full of them for Pavelski. He reached the Stanley Cup Final twice, once with the San Jose Sharks in 2016 and once with the Stars in the 2020 bubble here in Edmonton, but his teams were constantly contenders. You don’t play in 201 career playoff games by accident.\n\nAnd Pavelski’s not the only veteran who lost a golden opportunity for a first championship. Ryan Suter is 39, Benn is 34 and Matt Duchene is 33. There will be more chances for those last three, for sure, as the Stars are built for the present and the future. But this was the top team in the Western Conference, a team that checked every box with its talent, its depth, its structure, its blue line, its goaltending. It was supposed to be their year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut an 0-for-14 performance on the power play, coupled with four power-play goals allowed in Games 5 and 6, doomed them to another offseason of what-ifs. The Stars outshot the Oilers 35-10 in Game 6, the largest shot differential and the fewest shots ever allowed in a series-clinching loss. Right up until the very end, as they peppered Oilers goaltender Stuart Skinner with shots in a frantic six-on-five, they believed they would somehow win the game, the series and the Stanley Cup.\n\n“Hockey’s hard, you know?” Seguin said. “You need a lot of things to go right. You need to have that opportunity. We had that opportunity. We went through a gantlet and beat some really good teams (Vegas and Colorado) and knew we had something special. Lost to a team that we thought we could beat, and sometimes that’s the playoffs. Sometimes it’s that one bounce, one goal, one save. That’s why we all love it. That’s why this is the hardest damn trophy in the world to win.”\n\nJohnston, in just his second postseason, has years of chances ahead of him. And even if the Stars start shedding some veterans through attrition and free agency, he believes the team is well set up for future runs.\n\n“A lot of really good guys who have a lot of hockey ahead,” Johnston said. “And even our older guys have a lot of really good hockey ahead of them. It’s hard to look into the future right now and look past (tonight), but it’s definitely exciting.”\n\nSeguin was all raw emotion in the wake of the loss, a mix of appreciation and devastation. Hockey’s like that.\n\n“There’s a lot of emotion right now, a lot of disappointing, but heck yeah, (we) had a ton of fun, too,” he said. “We had a blast being in these big moments, guys grinding, and the ups and downs. I love this s—. So that was awesome. … Unfortunately, you have to lose a lot to win in this league. I don’t know why it’s like that, but (you have to) learn some lessons, keep this taste, and get ready for next year.”\n\n(Top photo of Joe Pavelski and Connor McDavid: Codie McLachlan / Getty Images)",

            "title": "As Paramount Global Preps For Shareholder Meeting And Town Hall, Details Of Revised Skydance Offer Surface",
            "summary": "As Paramount Global approaches Tuesday’s annual shareholder meeting and a high-stakes town hall for employees the following day, new details are emerging about Skydance Media‘s latest acquisition offer.\n\nThe David Ellison-led Skydance, which has been in the running for months to take control of Paramount, had sweetened its offer in recent days in order to assuage the concerns of non-voting shareholders. In the current scenario, those shareholders would be in line to receive $15 a share, a 26% premium over the company’s stock price as of Friday. Sources familiar with the discussions confirmed the proposed terms to Deadline after The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg had reported them earlier Sunday.\n\nIn a two-step transaction, Skydance would first acquire National Amusements, which controls nearly 80% of the voting shares of Paramount, though only about 10% of its equity value. The second step would see the company pump cash into Paramount, which would then acquire Skydance. Those are just the broad outlines, of course, as the specific structure of the new entity is the subject of considerable back and forth. Adding yet more intrigue was a report from the WSJ that National Amusements has received overtures from other potential acquirers, including one from producer Steven Paul valuing the company at around $3 billion.\n\nWhile many in Hollywood, among them top filmmakers like James Cameron, have come out in support of the Skydance deal, a separate scenario involving private equity behemoth Apollo Global Management and Sony Pictures Entertainment drew a lot of fans on Wall Street. Prospects of the Apollo/Sony option have seemingly dimmed in recent days. SPE chief Tony Vinciquerra told Deadline last week that talks were “progressing” between the parties but he also declined to cite Paramount or other M&A opportunities during remarks at a recent Sony investor presentation.\n\nWhile Skydance’s offer has been sweetened multiple times, and a special committee of Paramount’s board of directors has reportedly given its thumbs-up, a few sticking points remain. Perhaps the biggest is indemnification, the official term for who would back the company if shareholders or other stakeholders decide to sue over the merger. In recent months, as Skydance and its backers, including RedBird Capital, have pursued a deal, the notion of Class B (non-voting) shareholders taking National Amusements CEO Shari Redstone to court has become a realistic threat. One source told Deadline Sunday night that it could potentially derail the deal, as could haggling over a “go-shop” provision that could enable Paramount and National Amusements to seek a better offer than that from Skydance.\n\nThe New York Times reported on the remaining hurdles to a deal on Sunday.\n\nReps from Skydance, Paramount and Redstone declined comment.\n\nThe shareholder meeting and the town hall are both set to be significant moments for the three-pronged Office of the CEO installed after Bob Bakish’s ouster earlier this spring. Acquisition news is not expected to be made at the meeting, though the company’s post-Bakish strategy should become a bit more clear. Divvying up the CEO duties are Brian Robbins, President & CEO of Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon; George Cheeks, President & CEO of CBS; and Chris McCarthy, President & CEO Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and Paramount Media Networks. Each delivered brief remarks on Paramount’s quarterly earnings call in April but did not take questions from Wall Street analysts, instead promising to lay out more details soon about their strategic vision. “Soon” officially arrives this week.\n\nAt the shareholder meeting, which will be conducted virtually, the execs will deliver a presentation to investors. They are expected to expand on it on Wednesday during a town hall meeting with employees, who are eager to learn more about leadership’s plans. While Paramount’s recent history has been replete with dramatic moments, the current intrigue has taken on an existential dimension. “There’s a lot of emotion involved because of Shari’s family legacy,” one source observed. “It’s only adding to what is already a really complex financial situation to work out.”\n\nWith uncertainty clouding Paramount, having a troika at the top is also introducing new uneasiness among the rank and file. Multiple sources inside the company have described to Deadline an increasingly stressful atmosphere given the fact that three senior execs who have steadily risen through the ranks in recent years are now also responsible for the company’s Wall Street profile. As Robbins, Cheeks and McCarthy look to make a favorable impression, each has considerably more experience in the entertainment realm than with financial operations or corporate governance. As they collectively replace Bakish amid rampant speculation about the company’s future, the intensity of the effort has radiated across their respective silos.\n\nParamount’s beleaguered stock has slipped 17% this year to date as investors have fretted about its effort to profit from streaming even as linear TV continues its inexorable decline. Shares are worth about one-third what they were in 2019 after Redstone’s long-planned reunion of Viacom and CBS finally became reality.\n\nThe company did manage last month to pull off a carriage renewal with Charter, the No. 1 U.S. pay-TV operator, without the damaging blackouts that hit Disney in a tussle with Charter last summer.\n\n“We had expected to see at least some longer-tail networks get dropped, so we would consider this part a win for Paramount,” wrote MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman in a recent note to clients, adding that the financials of the agreement remain unknown. “Of course, the total rate Charter agreed to pay Paramount for the entire portfolio of networks, including CBS, Paramount+ ad-tier, Showtime linear and the cable networks, will determine the true degree of the win or loss. Keeping carriage at the expense of accepting a big discount to prior affiliate fee rates would be just as detrimental to future cash flows.”",

On Friday, word leaked that the special committee of the Paramount board of directors had recommended to Shari Redstone the deal proposed by a consortium led by David Ellison of Skydance Media and Gerry Cardinale of RedBird Capital, after the group sweetened its bid over the course of the last week. On Sunday afternoon, the Journal reported that the sweetener included an offer to buy nonvoting shares at $15 each, or the option to roll them into the new deal, a premium of about 25 percent to Friday’s close. But whether the board’s recommendation is good enough for Shari remains to be seen. She alone is the decider.\n\nIn truth, I’ve never seen so much obsessive, minute-to-minute media coverage around a deal with so little actual deal heat from potential buyers. Aside from Skydance/RedBird and Sony/Apollo—both of which have seemed somewhat indifferent to the asset at times, and keener to walk away than to complete the deal—there ain’t a whole lot of buyer interest in Paramount Global. It’s nutty, and I know I’ve done my part in contributing to the media frenzy. But I find it fascinating from an M&A point of view because it’s been such a bizarre and lengthy process, and Shari could still decide to do nothing at the end of all this mishegas, which has seen the departure of the company’s C.E.O. and four of its board members along the way. Shareholders would hate it if she walked away at this point, but she’ll probably face investor lawsuits no matter what she decides. (This is neither investment nor legal advice.)",

The second step would then see Skydance merge with Paramount to create a combined company valued at around $5 billion.\n\nThis cash-out option is part of a move to answer opposition to the bid by Paramount’s minority shareholders, who have argued that Skydance’s bid would prioritize Redstone at the expense of the rest of the company’s investors.\n\nIn addition to Skydance, Sony Pictures Entertainment and Apollo Global Management submitted a joint $26 billion all-cash offer for the company, which would see the former take a majority stake and operational control and the latter take a minority stake.

            "summary": "France Report: Kylian Mbappé has officially signed a contract with Real Madrid Published Jun. 2, 2024 5:20 p.m. ET share facebook x reddit link\n\nFresh off winning its record 15th UEFA Champions League title, Real Madrid has finalized the long-expected addition of superstar forward Kylian Mbappé, per a report from soccer journalist Fabrizio Romano.\n\nReal Madrid will announce the addition of Mbappé next week after he verbally committed to the Spanish soccer giant in February, per Romano.\n\nMbappé and Real Madrid have been linked for several years, as the 25-year-old France national team captain grew up a fan of the powerhouse La Liga club to the point where he took Spanish lessons as a teenager in order to speak the language fluently. However, French club Paris Saint-Germain repeatedly — and often successfully — fought to keep Mbappé around in the short term, even enlisting the help of France president Emmanuel Macron at one point to convince the superstar to remain on in his native country at the club level.\n\nThe relationship between Mbappé and PSG has deteriorated, however, in recent years, and after another reported flirtation with Real Madrid last offseason, Mbappé confirmed in May that this current club season would be his last with PSG.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMbappé remains a France sports icon due to his already-legendary national team career. As a 19-year-old in the 2018 FIFA Men's World Cup, Mbappé scored four goals to help Les Bleus win the title and was named Best Young Player in the tournament after becoming the first male teenager to both score a brace in a World Cup match and score in the World Cup Final since Pelé. Four years later, Mbappé won 2022 FIFA Men's World Cup Golden Boot after his eight goals nearly carried an injury-plagued France squad to a repeat World Cup title. However, France lost to Argentina, captained by Mbappé's then-PSG teammate Lionel Messi, in the final despite a hat trick from Mbappé.\n\nWith Real Madrid, Mbappé joins Brazilian forward Vinícius Junior and English midfielder Jude Bellingham to form an attacking trio that seems destined to join other famed Madrid groups as one of the greatest of all time at the club level.\n\nThe addition of Bellingham last offseason propelled Madrid back to the top of club soccer after a disappointing 2022-23 season by its lofty standards. Led by Vinícius and Bellingham, Carlo Ancelotti's squad won the Spanish La Liga and Supercopa titles as well as the aforementioned Champions League triumph this past season. Vinícius and Bellingham are both considered serious contenders for this year's Ballon D'Or trophy, FIFA's award for the best men's soccer player in the world.\n\nBefore Mbappé joins Real Madrid's two incumbent superstars next season, however, he will lead France into a loaded 2024 Euros field that also includes Bellingham's talented England squad. Mbappé has also expressed a desire to lead France's men's soccer team at the 2024 Paris Olympics, though he will need permission from Real Madrid to do so. Macron's only comment upon the news Mbappé would leave PSG last month was to urge Real Madrid to grant its incoming star that permission.\n\n[Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

The move will become official on July 1, when La Liga's transfer window opens.\n\nEuropean soccer's worst-kept secret for months reached its conclusion just one day after Madrid defeated Dortmund in the UEFA Champions League final. The win extended the club's record to 15 titles in the international club tournament. No other team has more than seven.\n\n\"It's the only little thing that maybe we're missing, in terms of that clinical 9 (striker),\" Madrid star Jude Bellingham said after the final. \"If [Mbappé] was to come and give us that, we'd be in a really, really good place. He'd take us to another level.\"\n\nMbappé becomes the third international soccer superstar to leave PSG in the last two years.

The deadline to do so expired at the end of July 2023.\n\nMbappé declared his intention to leave PSG in February after deciding not to renew his contract with the Ligue 1 club. The club will now lose their star forward as a free transfer once his contract expires June 30 after reportedly rejecting a €200 million transfer offer from Madrid in 2021.\n\nMbappé's new contract, according to BBC Sport, is a five-year deal through the 2028-29 season. He will make €15 million ($16.3 million) per season with a €150 million ($163.9 million) signing bonus to be paid out over the next five years.\n\nAccording to insider Fabrizio Romano, the deal is less money than the club initially offered in 2022 and more in line with what other Madrid stars like Bellingham and Vinicius Junior are paid. It also includes bonuses for winning awards and a percentage of his image rights, Romano says.\n\nLA LIGA NEWS:Barcelona fires club legend Xavi weeks after announcing coach would stay next season\n\nHow Mbappé signing will affect Real Madrid\n\nRomano included in his report that many players are very excited by the signing of Mbappé after years of attempts. He said the 2023-24 La Liga champions have long trusted the process by those in charge to keep the club in a position to \"win every single competition, to be competitive in every single trophy.\"\n\nReal Madrid had other contract news break Sunday as well: Croatian midfielder Luka Modrić will sign a new deal to stick with Los Blancos next week.\n\n\"Modrić didn’t care about money, he rejected two big proposals,\" Romano wrote in his report.\n\nThat statement, if true, further reflects players' trust in club officials at Real Madrid.\n\nReal Madrid winger Rodrygo sparked speculation about a possible intent to leave the club when he didn't rule out a departure before the Champions League final. The Brazilian had been linked to Liverpool ahead of the summer transfer window, but he shut down all of those rumors following the game.\n\n\"Of course, I'm going to stay at Real Madrid. Why should I leave? I'm staying,\" he told reporters.\n\nIt isn't clear how much Modrić's and Rodrygo's decisions were affected by the club's move to bring in Mbappé. It seems it didn't hurt Madrid's case, even if Rodrygo may lose playing time following the French striker's arrival.\n\nINTER MIAMI:Messi's MLS team beats out Super Bowl, Stanley Cup, World Series champs for sports business award\n\nKylian Mbappé's last year at PSG\n\nMbappé scored 27 goals and tallied seven assists in 24 starts for PSG this past season.

The club also won Ligue 1 – for a third straight year and sixth time in Mbappé's seven-year stint – and the French Super Cup during the 2023-24 season.\n\nThe French club was not able to advance to the Champions League final this year after it fell to eventual runners-up Dortmund in the semifinal on a 2-0 aggregate score.

            "title": "Is Djokovic back on track to defend his French Open title?",
            "summary": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nPARIS -- IT WAS WELL past 3 in the morning Sunday when Novak Djokovic finally raised his arms in triumph, as the dedicated fans in the stands at Court Philippe-Chatrier, many huddled in blankets, rose to their feet.\n\nIt had been five grueling sets and nearly 4½ hours of battling -- and drop shots and relentless running. But the world No. 1 had finally gotten past Lorenzo Musetti 7-5, 6-7(6), 2-6, 6-3, 6-0 to advance to the fourth round at the French Open. It marked the latest finish in history for a match at the tournament, and the fatigue and relief was evident on Djokovic's face as he addressed the crowd moments later.\n\n\"That was perhaps the best match I ever played here,\" Djokovic, 37, said in French. \"The most exciting. Thank you so much. And now, who's going to sleep? It's impossible to sleep now with all this adrenaline. If you're going to celebrate, I'm coming too.\"\n\nIt might seem surprising that Djokovic -- a man tied for the most major title victories in tennis history with 24, and the defending champion at Roland Garros -- would be so emotional about merely reaching the second week. But this season has been full of disappointments and early exits. When Djokovic fell behind to Musetti, 22, he had been staring down his worst result at a major since the Australian Open in 2017 and the loss of his No. 1 ranking. It would have been yet another shocking result, in a year full of them.\n\nIn those early hours Sunday morning, Djokovic rediscovered some of his signature magic -- and potentially got his season back on track.\n\n\"Everyone has seen Djokovic's struggles, and now players believe they have a chance to beat him, but if he starts to find the greatness that has made him who he is, that s--- is out the window,\" Brad Gilbert, Coco Gauff's coach and former coach of Andre Agassi and Andy Roddick, told ESPN. \"If the greatness of 'Joker' is there, it doesn't matter what the other guy is doing, beating him is going to be extremely difficult.\"\n\nLAST SEASON, DJOKOVIC won three major titles and tied the overall Grand Slam record. In November, after advancing to the title match at the ATP Finals, he was asked how he would be able to stay motivated in the new season.\n\n\"Well, you can win four Slams and Olympic gold,\" Djokovic said with a smile, but in complete seriousness. \"I mean, I have always the highest ambitions and goals. That's not going to be different for the next year, that's for sure. The drive that I have is still there.\"\n\nBut Djokovic's dream for all four major titles ended early. He lost in the semifinals at the Australian Open in January to eventual champion Jannik Sinner, and since then he hasn't been able to turn his season around. In the four tournaments he played after, he failed to reach a final and has experienced some truly baffling losses to players well outside the top 20, such as Luca Nardi in the round of 32 at Indian Wells and Tomas Machac in the semifinals at Geneva last week.\n\nHe was injured when a water bottle dropped onto his head at the Italian Open, and he later said the nausea, dizziness and headaches caused him made him feel like a \"different player\" on the court. He lost to Alejandro Tabilo two days after the incident.\n\nHe arrived in Paris having played at Geneva -- a rarity for him during the week before a major -- and clearly unhappy with how the season had fared. He said he had \"low expectations and high hopes\" for the French Open but was optimistic he could turn things around during the fortnight.\n\nIf Djokovic had lost to Musetti, it would have been the earliest loss for Djokovic in a major since he lost in the second round in the 2017 Australian Open. Clive Mason/Getty Images\n\n\"I have been saying for quite a while that in terms of clay I want to peak here in Paris, in Roland Garros,\" Djokovic said before play got underway. \"Last year I had an amazing year, and particularly here in Roland Garros, and hopefully I can, yeah, have a great tournament.\n\n\"Of course it does affect me, you know, the five months that I had so far in the year that haven't been great in terms of my tennis. That's why I have a kind of an approach that is focused on a daily basis, more trying to build the form and momentum so that I can have a better chance to reach further in the tournament.\"\n\nAnd Djokovic has seemingly gotten better in each match he's played at the French Open. He struggled at times with his movement in his 6-4, 7-6 (3), 6-4 opening-round victory over Pierre-Hugues Herbert, a wild card ranked No. 142 in the world, and he even took what appeared to be a hard fall by the net in the third set.\n\nDjokovic appeared more confident, and was moving more freely, in his more straightforward second-round victory over Roberto Carballes Baena 6-4, 6-1, 6-2.\n\nAgainst the athletic and fearless Musetti, Djokovic needed to dig deep and find his way back, after blowing a 4-1 lead and set point on serve in the second set and then falling into a 2-1 deficit. But something happened in the fourth set at 2-all and he seized control -- and then never looked back.\n\n\"It didn't feel great playing him that third set [and] at beginning of the fourth,\" Djokovic said after the match. \"The crowd definitely got me going. I really needed that push, I really needed that energy. And 2-all in the fourth, they start chanting my name and I just felt a great new wave of willpower and energy. And I think I was a different player from that moment onwards. I think from that moment I probably lost only one game the rest of the match.\"\n\nTHE LOSS TO SINNER at the Australian Open was the first sign Djokovic's season wasn't going to plan. But it was the loss to Nardi at Indian Wells that truly made his opponents take notice -- and change their approach to matches against him.\n\nAfter Casper Ruud defeated Djokovic -- for the first time in six tries -- in the semifinals in Monte Carlo in April, he said he had entered the match with a different mentality than in the past.\n\n\"I think what really motivated me and helped me a bit today was maybe that I thought about, you know, he lost a match in Indian Wells to Luca Nardi, and he showed there that he's also vulnerable sometimes,\" Ruud said after their match. \"Not many times in a year, but a few days here and there he's possible to beat ... If you see that many or other players have beaten him before, you believe a bit more in yourself also.\"\n\nTabilo had also watched Djokovic's loss to Nardi and he too was shocked, but also encouraged by the result. He was nervous as he prepared for their round of 32 meeting in Rome, but also more optimistic than he would have been previously.\n\n\"It gives you hope,\" Tabilo told ESPN this week. \"It really does help also knowing that him coming in this year, he's not at his best form. And that also not only gives you a little bit of confidence, but it gives you a little bit more hope that you can battle a little bit more with him.\"\n\nDjokovic is the defending French Open champ and No. 1 seed, but he has yet to win a title this season. Dan Istitene/Getty Images\n\nGilbert said he believes players of Djokovic's caliber have an aura around them, and most players don't think they have any chance of competing with them. But when one is able to do it, it can change everything.\n\n\"When you're someone like Talibo and you're playing 'Normal Djokovic,' it's like being down 3-0 when you're walking to the court. That's the equity that a player like Djokovic has and has built for himself with his results,\" Gilbert said. \"But then, when you see Djokovic on TV and he's losing [the matches he has], you think, 'Oh geez, I've never seen this happen, maybe it will happen again.' Those kind of losses can change someone else's self-belief and remove that advantage.\"\n\nDespite the lopsided 6-2, 6-3 score, Tabilo still didn't believe he would pull off the victory until the final points of the match.\n\n\"I won the first set pretty comfortably and I was like, 'All right, this can't be this like this, he has to bounce back at some time,'\" Tabilo said. \"Honestly, I was even ready just to go for a third set already. I mean something has to happen, it's Novak Djokovic. He can turn it around whenever.\"\n\nDJOKOVIC IS ONE major title away from surpassing Margaret Court for the most ever, and he already holds the most in the Open era and most among men. He has never publicly complained about the pressure that comes with chasing history, but others have spoken about the toll such expectations can take. Serena Williams, the 23-time major champion, spoke openly about it.\n\n\"I'd be lying if I said I didn't want that record,\" Williams wrote in the Vogue essay announcing her retirement in 2022. \"Obviously I do ... Maybe I thought about it too much, and that didn't help.\"\n\nDjokovic did admit this week that he has struggled with staying motivated outside the big events like the Grand Slams and the Olympics, and he was concerned it would become a larger issue going forward.\n\n\"I know the moment is going to arrive sooner or later where I'm just going to have off weeks,\" Djokovic said after his second-round match. \"Where I'm struggling to push myself or deliver what needs to be delivered on the court ... I'm focused pretty much solely on Grand Slams and Olympics this year, and playing for my country, really. That's something that really drives me the most.\"\n\nThere appeared to be no such issue late in the match Sunday, no shortage of drive as he ran down every ball Musetti hit his way. Now Djokovic not only remains in contention to defend his Roland Garros crown, but has worked his way back atop the favorites list.\n\nBut winning his fourth French Open title won't be easy.\n\nOn Monday, Djokovic will face Francisco Cerundolo, the No. 23 seed who is back in the fourth round for the second consecutive year. They have never played before, but Cerundolo will have undoubtedly studied what players like Tabilo and Nardi did in their matches in order to pull off the upset.\n\nIf Djokovic advances to the quarterfinals, he will face Ruud, a two-time finalist at Roland Garros, or Taylor Fritz, who has dubbed himself \"Claylor\" due to his success on the surface this season. Daniil Medvedev, Holger Rune and Alexander Zverev are possible semifinal opponents. Sinner, the No. 2 seed, and Carlos Alcaraz, the No. 3 seed, are on the opposite side of the draw and could await in the final if Djokovic reaches it.\n\nWith Rafael Nadal, the 14-time French Open champion, eliminated in the first round in what is expected to be his final appearance at the tournament, Djokovic is the only men's champion remaining. With Djokovic's struggles in the months leading in, many believed this tournament could be the clearest signal of a changing of the guard in men's tennis. But after Sunday, it appears Djokovic isn't ready to concede just yet. And maybe, just maybe, the win over Musetti marked the turning point of his year that he's been so desperately seeking.\n\n\"Obviously by his standards, this season has been a surprising one,\" Gilbert said. \"But he came to Wimbledon in 2018 having not won a major in over two years and [following] elbow injuries [and having undergone surgery] and then he won it. He could turn it around here again and win it. That's the beauty of tennis and that's part of his greatness.\"",

            "title": "French Open’s ‘prime-time’ slot is the graveyard shift no player wants",
            "summary": "As another messy, rainy day at Roland Garros began to unfold on Saturday afternoon, it gradually became clear that things were taking a left turn. With certain third-round matches to be finished, the French Open organisers opted to move the uncompleted contest between Zizou Bergs and Grigor Dimitrov to Court Philippe-Chatrier before Novak Djokovic’s night session match, which was scheduled to begin at 8.15pm. Unless every match finished in straight sets, it was obvious that chaos would follow.\n\nIt is fair to say that those matches did not finish efficiently. The match on court, Alexander Zverev v Tallon Griekspoor, immediately descended into a dramatic five-set battle. Then Bergs forced a fourth set. Djokovic and Lorenzo Musetti entered the court at about 10.30pm, with Djokovic closing off his excellent five-set comeback victory at 3.07am, the latest finish in the history of the French Open.\n\nNo other prominent sport in the world has its athletes competing in the early hours of the morning, yet tennis has managed to make it a regular occurrence. In recent years, matches have finished as late as 4.05am at the Australian Open with Andy Murray last year and 4.55am at the Mexican Open in 2022.\n\n“I think it’s really unhealthy,” Ons Jabeur, the world No 9, said. “I hope Novak is recovering really well for the next one. But yeah, we are trying to push to have better scheduling. But, you know, when you have long matches sometimes you don’t know. Obviously with the prime matches it is also more difficult. I feel like 8.15 is really late to start the match.”\n\nAt about 1am, Casper Ruud closed off his four-set win over Tomás Martín Etcheverry before addressing the Court Suzanne-Lenglen crowd with a smile: “I love tennis and I love Roland Garros,” he said. “But I’m not sure if I love playing at 1am.” Ruud was still going through his post-match routine and talking about it on X as Djokovic’s match came to an end. For the players, the work does not stop as they leave the court.\n\n“I feel like a lot of times people think you’re done, but really, 3am, then you have press and then you have to shower, eat and then a lot of times people do treatments, so that’s probably not going to bed until 5am at the earliest, maybe 6am, and even 7am,” Coco Gauff said. “I definitely think it’s not healthy. It may not be fair for those who have to play late because it does ruin your schedule.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Casper Ruud’s match also stretched into Sunday. ‘I love tennis but I’m not sure I love playing at 1am,’ he said. Photograph: Alain Jocard/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhile the French Open used to receive criticism for its early finishes with no floodlights, nights at Roland Garros have now swung to completely different extremes since the roof was inaugurated on Philippe-Chatrier in 2021. In some ways, things are even worse.\n\nWith the arrival of the roof on Court Philippe-Chatrier and floodlights around the grounds, the French Open initiated its controversial night session, selling the rights of one prime-time match per day to Prime Video for a hefty fee as the tournament searched for new sources of income to transform the grounds. The tournament had previously been carried entirely by France Télévisions, the free-to-air national broadcaster.\n\nDespite how the night contests have been billed as the feature match each day – and the French Tennis Federation has received significant criticism for not scheduling a single women’s match in the night session so far this year – it often seems that players are in a race to avoid receiving the graveyard slot. Both Rafael Nadal and Iga Swiatek have repeatedly requested earlier matches. Carlos Alcaraz also categorically expressed his disapproval for the night session.\n\n“It’s really difficult to recover when you are going to go to sleep so, so late,” he said. “For me it’s much better to finish at 6pm, having dinner really, really well at restaurant, a good restaurant, good food. So everything is better if you finish early.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Recap Free weekly newsletter The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the Australian and US Opens, the nights are warm. The cold conditions in Paris, though, make the clay courts even slower, the ball barely moving through the cold air. For much of Saturday’s match, Djokovic struggled to hit through Musetti’s excellent defence in conditions that resembled quicksand.\n\nThese night sessions are also extremely difficult for all the other people involved in the sport. Fans should not need to make such a commitment for the sake of entertainment. The ballkids, many of whom are minors, and the linespeople should be able to return to their homes at an acceptable time. After midnight, there are few transport options for anyone leaving the site.\n\nWhat is clear is that the scheduling committees at tournaments need to be more flexible, more willing to move matches, to impose clear limits on when matches can begin and to change start times. The ATP and WTA tours have attempted to address the issue at their own non-slam events this year, initiating new match scheduling rules that include (three-set) matches not being allowed to start after 11pm and matches at 10.30pm requiring a move to an alternative court. It remains to be seen how effective they will be.\n\nSuch is the unpredictable nature of professional tennis, a day after constant delays and an early morning finish, Sunday’s three-match day session was shorter than Djokovic’s match alone. By 4.31pm, the planned day session schedule was complete.",

            "summary": "TAIWAN – Lifelike \"digital humans\" that will serve as everything from your nurse to your interior decorator. Virtual fashion models. A digital simulation of the entire earth.\n\nThose were just a few of the products and ideas floated by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during his keynote address at the 2024 Taipei International Information Technology Show, better known as Computex. Huang enthralled a packed house with the claim that the world has entered a \"new industrial revolution.\"\n\n\"In the future, Taiwan will build computers that walk,\" Huang said as he showed images of nine humanoid robots and several wheeled robots while emphasizing that this robotic \"future\" is already here.\n\nThe possibilities are endless, he said. Artificial Intelligence will create AI teams with an \"agent\" that interacts with you. The \"agent,\" however, is a combination of dozens of different types of generative AIs. Artificial intelligence that masters the laws of physics. A new computer board with a chip called Blackwell so fast it makes a mockery of Moore’s Law.\n\nIn a talk that lasted nearly two hours, Huang spoke passionately about how radically different \"the generative computing era\" will be from the past. Much of the tech talk was incomprehensible to non-experts, but the overall message was clear: the computing world has been mostly running on ideas that are 60 years old. But, after 20 years of work in collaboration with other Taiwanese tech giants such as TSMC, Nvidia and its partners have reinvented the computing wheel. No more info retrieval. Instead, when you want info, it will be generated – thus being more relevant and up-to-date than anything that can be \"found.\"\n\nHuang showed off four new \"AI laptops,\" and spoke about the next wave of AI: Physical AIs. These will include robots that learn in a virtual world that simulates the laws of physics, teaching the robot to flawlessly act in the real world. \"In the future, anything that moves will be automated,\" said a voiceover in one of the videos Huang showed. But he stressed that \"the future\" isn’t some abstract idea, noting that everything he had shown is currently in development. Huang spoke of \"robotic factories\" being created in Taiwan now by companies such as Foxconn, the world’s largest electronics maker.\n\nWatching Huang’s presentation offered a great deal of validation to the fears that AI and robots will take or replace human jobs, and perhaps humans themselves. But Huang sees a bright future as we break free of CPUs and enter a \"tectonic shift\" that includes something called \"the omniverse.\"\n\nMOST AMERICANS EXPECT AI ABUSES TO IMPACT 2024 ELECTION: SURVEY\n\nHuang is immensely popular in Taiwan. Since he arrived in Taipei on May 26 he’s been hounded by packs of somewhat aggressive reporters. When leaving a dinner with some of the richest tech titans on the planet, Huang hopped into a regular yellow taxicab, not some chauffeured limo.\n\nFORMER OPENAI BOARD MEMBER REVEALS WHY SAM ALTMAN WAS OUSTED LAST NOVEMBER\n\nLocal newspapers use terms like \"rockstar\" to describe him, while another common comparison is to Steve Jobs. Like Jobs, Huang understands the power of a \"look,\" almost always wearing his trademark black leather jacket, despite temperatures in Taiwan this time of year hovering around 85 degrees.\n\nJobs, however, was called \"difficult\" by even close friends and had a reputation for being somewhat aloof and inaccessible. In this regard, Huang couldn’t be more different. He’s self-deprecating, especially about his language skills, despite apparently being relatively fluent in Mandarin Chinese. During the Computex presentation, he told the crowd he’d like to speak in Chinese but that his brain couldn’t run that fast so he’d stick to English, which he mostly did while getting in plenty of well-timed Chinese one-liners as well as several sentences in Taiwanese (or Hokkien, a local language spoken by some 70% of Taiwanese).\n\nELON MUSK'S XAI GETS $6B IN NEW FUNDING AND ANNOUNCES VALUATION\n\nHuang ended his address with a tribute to Taiwan, \"the unsung hero of the coming AI industrial revolution.\" His praise for his birthplace of Taiwan was, of course, popular with the crowd and those watching the livestream of the event, but Huang has used both words and deeds to demonstrate his sincerity.\n\nJust before throwing out the ceremonial first pitch at a Saturday game between two of Taiwan’s professional baseball teams, Huang told the media, \"This is a very exciting time for Taiwan… We are at the beginning of a new age of computing, the age of AI, and Taiwan is at the center.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nHuang has repeatedly touted the overachieving, underappreciated nation of Taiwan.\n\n\"Taiwan is one of the most important countries in the world. It is at the center of the electronics industry. The computer industry is built because of Taiwan, so it’s a very, very important country,\" he told a local reporter who asked for a comment as Huang was buying snacks at a night market in Taipei.\n\nHuang repeated the word, country, not \"area,\" \"region,\" or some other generic neutral geographic moniker. His comments became headline news in Taiwan, and few think Huang misspoke. As Huang showed the 100-plus \"countries and regions\" that are working with Nvidia and other Taiwan tech companies to create this new future, one large area was not shaded green: The People’s Republic of China.",

The company had previously been operating on a slower two-year update timeline for chips.\n\nThe turnaround from Blackwell to Rubin was a matter of less than three months, underscoring the competitive frenzy in the AI chip market and Nvidia's sprint to preserve its dominant spot.\n\nAMD and Intel are two major competitors working to catch up, though their gross margins trailed Nvidia's in the most recent fiscal quarter. Companies like Microsoft , Google and Amazon are also vying for Nvidia's top spot, even as they are simultaneously some of Nvidia's biggest patrons. A flurry of startups are also working to enter the space.\n\n\"Today, we're at the cusp of a major shift in computing,\" Huang said Sunday. \"With our innovations in AI and accelerated computing, we're pushing the boundaries of what's possible and driving the next wave of technological advancement.\"\n\nThe Rubin chip platform will have new GPUs, the crucial graphic processing technology that helps train and launch AI systems. It will come with other new features like a central processor called \"Vera,\" though the Sunday announcement did not provide many details.\n\nShares of Nvidia were relatively flat at Friday's market close with shares trading at $1,096.",

Companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center — AI factories — to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence,” said Huang. “From server, networking and infrastructure manufacturers to software developers, the whole industry is gearing up for Blackwell to accelerate AI-powered innovation for every field.”\n\nTo address applications of all types, the offerings will range from single to multi-GPUs, x86- to Grace-based processors, and air- to liquid-cooling technology.\n\nAdditionally, to speed up the development of systems of different sizes and configurations, the NVIDIA MGX ™ modular reference design platform now supports NVIDIA Blackwell products. This includes the new NVIDIA GB200 NVL2 platform, built to deliver unparalleled performance for mainstream large language model inference, retrieval-augmented generation and data processing.\n\nGB200 NVL2 is ideally suited for emerging market opportunities such as data analytics, on which companies spend tens of billions of dollars annually. Taking advantage of high-bandwidth memory performance provided by NVLink®-C2C interconnects and dedicated decompression engines in the Blackwell architecture speeds up data processing by up to 18x, with 8x better energy efficiency compared to using x86 CPUs.\n\nModular Reference Architecture for Accelerated Computing\n\nTo meet the diverse accelerated computing needs of the world’s data centers, NVIDIA MGX provides computer manufacturers with a reference architecture to quickly and cost-effectively build more than 100 system design configurations.\n\nManufacturers start with a basic system architecture for their server chassis, and then select their GPU, DPU and CPU to address different workloads. To date, more than 90 systems from over 25 partners have been released or are in development that leverage the MGX reference architecture, up from 14 systems from six partners last year. Using MGX can help slash development costs by up to three-quarters and reduce development time by two-thirds, to just six months.\n\nAMD and Intel are supporting the MGX architecture with plans to deliver, for the first time, their own CPU host processor module designs. This includes the next-generation AMD Turin platform and the Intel® Xeon® 6 processor with P-cores (formerly codenamed Granite Rapids). Any server system builder can use these reference designs to save development time while ensuring consistency in design and performance.\n\nNVIDIA’s latest platform, the GB200 NVL2, also leverages MGX and Blackwell. Its scale-out, single-node design enables a wide variety of system configurations and networking options to seamlessly integrate accelerated computing into existing data center infrastructure.\n\nThe GB200 NVL2 joins the Blackwell product lineup, which also includes NVIDIA Blackwell Tensor Core GPUs, GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchips and the GB200 NVL72.\n\nAn Ecosystem Unites\n\nNVIDIA’s comprehensive partner ecosystem includes TSMC, the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturer and an NVIDIA foundry partner, as well as global electronics makers, which provide key components to create AI factories. These include manufacturing innovations such as server racks, power delivery, cooling solutions and more from companies such as Amphenol, Asia Vital Components (AVC), Cooler Master, Colder Products Company (CPC), Danfoss, Delta Electronics and LITEON.\n\nAs a result, new data center infrastructure can quickly be developed and deployed to meet the needs of the world’s enterprises — and further accelerated by Blackwell technology, NVIDIA Quantum-2 or Quantum-X800 InfiniBand networking , NVIDIA Spectrum™-X Ethernet networking and NVIDIA BlueField®-3 DPUs — in servers from leading systems makers Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Lenovo.\n\nEnterprises can also access the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform , which includes NVIDIA NIM™ inference microservices , to create and run production-grade generative AI applications.\n\nTaiwan Embraces Blackwell\n\nHuang also announced during his keynote that Taiwan's leading companies are rapidly adopting Blackwell to bring the power of AI to their own businesses.\n\nTaiwan’s leading medical center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, plans to use the NVIDIA Blackwell computing platform to advance biomedical research and accelerate imaging and language applications to improve clinical workflows, ultimately enhancing patient care.\n\nFoxconn, one of the world’s largest makers of electronics, is planning to use NVIDIA Grace Blackwell to develop smart solution platforms for AI-powered electric vehicle and robotics platforms, as well as a growing number of language-based generative AI services to provide more personalized experiences to its customers.\n\nAdditional Supporting Quotes\n\nR.

Simpson’s ex-wife and her friend, Ron Goldman, were stabbed to death outside of her Brentwood home on June 12, 1994. The following year, Simpson was tried for their murders and acquitted in a televised reading of the verdict watched by an estimated 150 million people.\n\n“She’s that picture of mom of the year,” Brian \"Kato\" Kaelin says in the docuseries, referencing Brown Simpson's two children with O.J., Sydney and Justin. Kaelin memorably testified during the eight-month trial, as he was living in Simpson’s guest house at the time of her death.\n\nKris Jenner, who became good friends with Nicole because her first husband, Robert Kardashian, was close with Simpson, says she continues to grieve her 30 years later. “You never get over losing a friend that way, and I think I pack it down so far deep inside,” she says of “one of the worst days I’ve ever experienced.”\n\nHere are the biggest revelations from the second half of “The Life & Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson.”\n\nNeed a break?

Nic, I’m so sorry.” Greer says Simpson also extended an apology to her. “He was just admitting that he did it, and he’s sorry,” Greer assesses.\n\nBrown family friend D'Anne Purcilly says that, at the visitation, Nicole’s mother, Juditha Brown, asked Simpson directly, “Did you do this?\"\n\nSimpson then looked down, Purcilly recalls, and said, \"'Dita, I loved her. I just loved her too much.’ I was like, 'He’s going to tell her he did it.' He didn’t. He just kept saying, over and over again, ‘I loved her too much.’”\n\nDominique’s complicated feelings about the shocking verdict: ‘Did you really want him to be guilty?’\n\nWhile Tanya and Denise hold Simpson responsible for Nicole’s death, Dominique is unsure of his culpability.\n\n“I knew that somebody was to blame, and I knew that somehow there was involvement\" by Simpson, she says. “I didn’t know to what extent. I still don’t know.”\n\nDominique says she experienced an array of emotions when the not-guilty verdict was read. “I was shocked. I don’t know. Relieved, disappointed, angry,\" she says. \"I mean, did you really want him to be guilty? Did you not want him to be guilty? It’s a tough question.”\n\nNicole Brown Simpson's sisters remember'adventurous' spirit before meeting O.J. Simpson\n\nConversations with Sydney Simpson about OJ's involvement in her mother’s death\n\nDenise says that, after his arrest, Sydney, then 8 or 9, expressed concerns that her father would be executed. As Denise tucked her into bed, Sydney asked, “’Is my daddy going to die?’ And I said, 'No,'” Denise remembers. Why did she ask? “’Well, don’t they put people who kill other people — don’t they kill them?’ And I said, ‘They’ve already said that they’re not going to do that, Sydney.’”\n\nPurcilly says she also had a difficult conversation with Sydney after the child visited Michael Jackson’s Neverland Ranch with Simpson. Sydney asked Purcilly if her kids could join them sometime.\n\n“I sat down with her,” says Purcilly, “and I said, ‘Sydney, you have to understand that I will never let my boys go be with your dad. Because I believe your dad killed your mother, and I can’t let my children go there. She just kind of looked at me and said, ‘Yeah. Yeah, I know.’ And she got up, and she ran out of the room.”\n\n‘A series’ of calls made reporting violence in the Simpson home after kids moved to Florida\n\nSimpson relocated to Florida with Sydney and Justin in 2000, but trouble followed their family. A distressed Sydney called Miami-Dade police in 2003 after reportedly getting into an argument with Simpson. The 17-year-old requested intervention for abuse. But Simpson's attorney, Yale Galanter, denied any incident to The Associated Press and said Simpson wasn’t home when Sydney called 9-1-1.\n\nAnd it wasn’t the only call for help. A docuseries producer surprised Denise when he informed her filmmakers discovered about 17 police reports of alleged incidents in Florida.\n\n“There was a series of 9-1-1 calls about violence inside the house,” a producer says off camera, adding the calls were made anonymously. Law enforcement “couldn’t do anything because they couldn’t determine whether there was any truth to it,” the producer adds.",

            "title": "O.J. 'Ripped' Nicole Brown Simpson's Pants, 'Got a Little Forcible' on Their 1st Date, Friends Claim in New Doc",
            "summary": "Lifetime's new four-part documentary The Life & Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson is revealing more claims of physical abuse against O.J. Simpson, including one instance during his first date with ex-wife Nicole in the late 1970s.\n\nNicole met O.J. in 1977 when she was 18 and working as a hostess at a Los Angeles restaurant. At the time, O.J. was still married to ex-wife Marguerite Whitley, but reportedly began courting Nicole immediately.\n\nIn the first episode of the docuseries, a friend of Nicole’s recalls noticing something off about Nicole’s pants after her first date with O.J., then 30.\n\n“When she came home, her pants were ripped… zipper was ripped,” says D’Anne Purcilly, whose then-husband David LeBon allowed Nicole to stay with him while she was living in Los Angeles. “And they were jeans. And David’s like ‘You can’t just rip jeans like a linen something.’”\n\nLebon says in the docuseries that he then questioned Nicole about what had happened.\n\n“I said ‘Nicole what happened to you?’ She said ‘He got a little forcible.’ And I said ‘Why would you let him do that to you?'\"\n\nAccording to Purcilly, LeBon was “really upset” and wanted to “kind of have a few words” with O.J.\n\n“And [Nicole] said ‘No, don’t. I really like him. I really, really like him.’” Purcilly recalls. “She fell in love with him I think the first time she met him.”\n\nBut according to Nicole’s three sisters, who share her story in the docuseries, she spent the majority of her seven-year marriage to O.J. smiling to mask the pain of verbal and physical abuse. The torment was vividly revealed to the world during O.J.’s trial for the 1994 murders of Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman.\n\nNicole Brown Simpson.

He lived the rest of his days in infamy until his death from cancer on April 10.\n\nThe docuseries features interviews with 50 people, including Nicole's sisters, other family members and friends, as well as never-before-seen footage of her.\n\nIf you are experiencing domestic violence, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233, or go to thehotline.org.

            "title": "Lifetime’s ‘The Life and Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson’ Gives Voice to a Victim Overshadowed by OJ’s Celebrity: ‘It Was Always About Him’",
            "summary": "In the upcoming Lifetime docuseries “The Life and Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson,” audiences will get to hear from O.J. Simpson‘s ex-wife Nicole, who was found murdered alongside Ronald Goldman in 1994 outside her Brentwood condominium, in ways most viewers have not before. Most of the nation associates her voice with the 911 call she made in October of 1993 to tell a dispatcher that Simpson had broken into her home. In “The Life and Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson,” however, audiences will hear Nicole speaking to her children Sydney and Justin, her father, Lou Brown, as well as friends including Kris Jenner.\n\nThe two-part series, which begins airing on June 1, comes just months after O.J. Simpson’s death due to metastatic prostate cancer and 30 years after Nicole and Ron Goldman’s murder on June 12, 1994.\n\nThe docu features 50 participants, including Nicole’s three sisters — Denise, Dominique and Tanya Brown — as well as close friends and fellow family members, some of whom have never been interviewed about the case. Exclusive home videos give a rare glimpse into the life of a woman who was all but forgotten during the 1995 “Trial of the Century,” in which Simpson was acquitted of killing his ex-wife and Goldman.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nWhen the doc’s executive producer Melissa Moore met Denise Brown a decade ago, she approached her about working on a project that honored Nicole.\n\n“I would say to Denise, ‘I really don’t know anything about Nicole,'” recalls Moore. “I told her that we really should do something to bring awareness to who she was because if you close your eyes and try to think of her voice you can’t.”\n\nDenise, who had been approached on numerous occasions about making a documentary about Nicole, was hesitant. She didn’t want the doc to be all about O.J. But last year Moore was able to gain Denise and her siblings’ trust, and together they began working on “The Life and Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson.” (The Brown sisters did not serve as producers on the project.)\n\nThe docuseries, which originally started out as a project that would involve Nicole’s children Sydney and Justin, now 38 and 35 years-old, morphed into telling Nicole’s life story via family, friends and unseen archival materials of her childhood as well as her adult life.\n\nVariety spoke to Denise, Dominique and Tanya Brown.\n\nThere have been many docs made about O.J. and Nicole, including the ESPN docuseries “OJ: Made in America,” which won the Oscar for best feature documentary in 2017. Now there is this highly anticipated docu. What do you attribute the ongoing fascination around the case to?\n\n\n\nDenise: I think the fascination around Nicole is because people don’t know who Nicole was. They only know him (O.J.). It was always about him. It was always about the trial. People don’t understand that this was a woman and her friend (Goldman) who were murdered in the most horrific way and then they were put down so much. They were just described so poorly and so ugly and so nasty. But that was to try to get somebody off going to prison. People need to understand that these were real people. Loving wonderful people who had families and who were loved and who were fun loving.\n\nDominique, in the documentary you mention that you and Denise didn’t speak for years because you thought that by her speaking out against O.J. during the trial and her activism around domestic violence post trial it put a spotlight on Nicole’s children, who don’t like media attention. How do you feel about this doc coming out in terms of them and the media attention it could lead to for them?\n\nDominique: We have been transparent with them and have been communicating with them, so they know about (this documentary). I stay in communication with the kids a lot. I know what’s going on in their lives, except for that I didn’t know how ill their father was. That came as a shock. But we have been totally transparent with them as far as this documentary being a beautiful portrayal of their mother and that it was made to humanize her. Her love for her children shines through.\n\nWhen O.J. Simpson died in April, did any of you feel relief?\n\nTanya: No. I was sad. I was really sad. It was just different emotions. I went over to Minnie’s (Dominique) and we cried and we hugged. Then what came after that was kind of acceptance.\n\nDominique: It was very complicated. It was very confusing. Naturally everybody was responding in different ways on social media and asking if you are okay? What’s happening? One person said, “Maybe you all can move on from this now,” but my heart was with Sydney and Justin. That’s where my heartache and my tears came from.\n\nFifty people were interviewed for this documentary. Did you all have say over who was and who was not interviewed?\n\nDenise: Yes. We did. What I wanted to see in this documentary was not the same people that always talk (about this case). That was really, really important to us because it was about telling new stories and having Nicole in a new light.\n\nI was surprised that Faye Resnick was interviewed for the doc given her relationship to the case in terms of the book she wrote four months after Nicole’s murder and the archival clip in the film where, Denise, you roll your eyes when she is mentioned.\n\nDenise: At one point, I said, no, I don’t want Faye Resnick to be a part of it. I also didn’t want (Nicole’s former boyfriend) Keith (Zlomsowitch) to be a part of it, because I thought that was going to take it in a negative direction. But you know what? Everything that Faye said in it is absolutely beautiful about Nicole. I’m really, really happy that she is a part of it and that she told some wonderful stories about their friendship.\n\nDominique: The way that Lifetime had explained it to us was that there were a lot of gaps. There was a period of time — Nicole growing up in Germany and Laguna — that we had a lot of stories about . But there was a period of time when Nicole was in L.A. where she would entertain people and have dinner parties and things at her house and Faye was one of the people that was included in that. So, Faye brought life to and a different perspective to a part of Nicole life when she was (living) in her freedom.\n\nIn an archival clip in the film O.J. tells Denise that he essentially funded your parents life. During the trial that was the narrative. Is there any truth to that?\n\nDominique: O.J. was very charismatic, and very friendly. He became part of the family right away. We did everything together as a family.\n\nDenise: But money wasn’t a part of that.",

            "summary": "Lifetime’s docuseries The Life and Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson shared new details of Nicole Brown Simpson‘s life before examining her tumultuous relationship with O.J. Simpson.\n\nThe first two installments of the four-part docuseries, which premiered on Saturday, June 1, featured interviews from Nicole’s star-studded friends such as Kris Jenner and Faye Resnick and members of her family.\n\nNicole and O.J. were married from 1985 to 1992 and welcomed two kids: daughter Sydney in 1985 and son Justin in 1988. Two years after the divorce, Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman were fatally stabbed outside of her home in Los Angeles. O.J. was named as the primary suspect in the case but was ultimately acquitted on the murder charges in 1995 after a high-profile criminal trial. The athlete, who died of prostate cancer at age 76 in April, was found liable for Nicole and Goldman’s deaths after their families sued him in a civil trial.\n\nWhile reflecting on Nicole’s tragic death, her sisters recalled the warning signs.\n\nRelated: Sharing Their Stories: Stars Who Survived Abuse As Rihanna recovers from being hit by Chris Brown, see photos of other stars who have moved on from abusive relationships\n\n“We would have our conversations and she would say, ‘Yeah we got into an argument last night. But it was no big deal.’ Was there something I should have picked up on?” Dominique Brown said during Saturday’s installment of the doc. “I probably will always think that. Was she sending me some subtle hints that something was going on? I don’t know.”\n\nDominique added: “Which makes me think how everyone needs someone to talk to. And I don’t think she had someone to talk to.”\n\nThe third and fourth installments of the Lifetime Doc, which air on Sunday, June 2, are expected to cover Nicole’s murder, O.J.’s trial and the aftermath of the scandal. The Life and Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson has relied heavily on snippets from Nicole’s diary, videotape footage from the 1996 civil trial deposition, audio from Nicole’s 911 calls and firsthand accounts from the police to shape their coverage.\n\nKeep scrolling for a breakdown of revelations from part 1 and 2 of The Life and Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson:\n\nO.J. Simpson’s Marriage to Marguerite Whitley\n\nThe doc addressed rumors that O.J. athlete was abusive toward his first wife, Marguerite Whitley. The first confessional highlighted Lawrence Schiller‘s experience as O.J.’s neighbor in the ’60s, including claims about O.J.’s temper. Schiller claimed it was the “talk of the neighborhood” about how O.J. would “push and shove” Whitley in public. Retired Los Angeles police officer Terry Schauer also discussed visiting O.J.’s home after receiving a call about domestic violence. “It was in a residential neighborhood that is off Mulholland Drive and west of the San Diego Freeway. We got to the home and we were met at the door by a woman. She had got into an argument with her husband and during the course of the argument he became violent with her,” Schauer recalled. “He struck her and as I recall, he pulled out some of her hair. My memory is that there was a clump of hair on the floor in the entryway of the home.” Schauer said O.J. and Whitley’s kids — Arnelle and Jason — were present at the time. “The children were there just being kids and standing around. They didn’t seem overly upset — that I recall. She was upset. He had left the scene. We spoke with her briefly but she didn’t want to go into a lot of detail about it,” he continued. “She just wanted to leave the house and she had no transportation. She declined a report and wouldn’t sign a report. She said, ‘My husband is O.J Simpson — the football player.’ She identified herself as Marguerite Simpson.” Whitley’s sister, Veterdata Jones, added: “I believe they met in high school but she was originally dating [O.J.’s friend] Al Cowlings.”I was five years old and I was a flower girl at their wedding.” According to Veterdata, O.J. and Whitley’s relationship changed once he found success in football. (O.J. notably played for the NFL for 11 seasons, primarily for the Buffalo Bills.) He later moved on with Nicole. Lifetime featured a message at the end of the segment, which read, “Marguerite Simpson has publicly denied any domestic abuse by O.J. Simpson.” “I think there was some defiance and anger and resentment on her part. And it overrode sound judgment and good sense perhaps. That is probably why the police had to come. It wasn’t because she didn’t have enough money to go,” Veterdata explained of tension between the pair when O.J. asked her to move out. “After they were divorced, she was walking through a department store and she saw O.J. carrying a bunch of bag and Nicole at his side. The divorce was not even a year old so that was hard.” Veterdata added: “She came home devastated, really hurt and angry. It was like putting a dagger in her heart and turning it around. And I don’t meant to describe it like that but she was traumatized. She was very hurt.” Related: O.J. Simpson's Family Guide: All About His 5 Kids, Former Spouses The late O.J. Simpson was father of five children, whom he shared with his two former spouses. The former athlete tied the knot with his first wife, Marguerite Whitley, in 1967. Prior to their 1979 split, the pair welcomed three kids together: Arnelle, Jason and Aaren. Simpson went on to wed Nicole Brown Simpson in […] The Early Days of O.J Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson’s Relationship\n\nNicole’s loved ones saw red flags with O.J. immediately. According to Brown family friend D’Anne Purcilly, Nicole’s first date with O.J. concerned because she came home with “ripped” pants. “The zipper was ripped and they were jeans. And [my ex-husband] David was like, ‘You can’t just rip jeans,'” Purcilly recalled. “I said, ‘Nicole, what happened to you?’ She said, ‘He got a little forceful.’ [But she didn’t want us to call the police]. She said, ‘No, don’t. I really like him. I really, really like him.'” Judie Manton, a friend of Nicole’s mother, questioned some of O.J.’s behavior, including requesting the whole family get manicures and pedicures. Manton referred to it as an example of O.J.’s “control” over them. Denise and Dominique, meanwhile, said O.J. would call their mother often to complain about Nicole. “She’s just a girl from Laguna that met a guy that swept her off her feet. They fell in love and had this perfect little life. Nicole was really in love,” Dominique noted. Nicole and O.J. got married eight years after they met. They welcomed their first child, daughter Sydney, in 1985. Nicole’s sisters said O.J. would often make comments about her weight during her pregnancy including that she was a “fat ass” who needed to go on a “diet.” “She loved being pregnant except she got really heavy and he didn’t like that,” Dominique said before Denise added, “He was not nice to her when she was pregnant. I remember her telling me one time, ‘You are so lucky that you don’t have a husband and you don’t have someone telling you what to do.'” Family friend Purcilly recalled a similar interaction, adding, “We were talking about delivering our babies. She said, ‘O.J. does not want me to deliver vaginally.’ And he didn’t want her nursing. That is sick. She said he wanted her to keep the same bod that she had. Those were all control things he did with her.” Nicole and O.J.’s second child — son Justin — was born in 1988. O.J Simpson’s Temper — and Abuse\n\nThe first time Denise witnessed O.J.’s anger was during a family outing. They had dinner before returning to O.J. and Nicole’s home, which is when Denise made an offhand comment about how O.J. took her sister for “granted.” “He started screaming at me. That went to walking from the bar, going to the staircase and throwing pictures of our family down into the foyer. This is the first time I ever saw him [so angry]. Everything started pulsating on his face and it was glazed over eyes,” Denise claimed. “It didn’t even look like he was there anymore.” She continued: “He comes back down the stairs and Nicole is standing there. He grabs her by the throat and puts her up against the kitchen door. He throws her out the door and she ends up on her boat with bloody elbows. Then he throws me out the door but I didn’t fall down. Then nothing was talked about anymore. Life went on as usual and it was never discussed again.” Footage from the 1996 civil trial showed O.J. recounting the incident. His version was that Nicole threw the pictures and he didn’t yell at all that night. Their neighbor Albert A. Aguilera recalled a story of O.J. allegedly attacking Nicole at a beach. “She was facing him and he was facing the water. Then all of a sudden, he reached out and slapped her. With one arm, he knocked her down,” Aguilera alleged. “He bent down trying to console her. He was trying to stop her from crying. She was having none of it. She seemed to me like she was more or less hurt that he even did that. Maybe she was as surprised as we were.” The issues with Nicole and O.J. reached its peak during a 1988 trip with her family to Hawaii for Christmas. While out for lunch, Denise recalled an encounter that left O.J. and Nicole at serious odds. “There was a gay couple that was sitting at a table and they thought Justin was just beautiful. One of the guys kissed Justin on the forehead and it was so sweet and nice. As soon as we walked outside, all hell broke loose,” Denise recalled. “She ran out of the car and he was going crazy. I later read in her diary that he had her up against the wall on the balcony. He was hurting her.” Footage from Cowlings’ deposition in the civil trial offered more details on the incident. “O.J. supposedly said, ‘Why did you have that gay guy hold my baby?’ She said, ‘Why are you concerned with him being gay? You father is gay,'” Cowlings said in reference to O.J.’s father, Jimmy Lee Simpson, who was a well-known drag queen and who came out as gay before his death. “He got very upset with her.” Days later, the police were alerted to a domestic violence incident, which ended with them documenting the abuse against Nicole. Related: O.J. Simpson Through The Years: His Life and Controversies O.J. Simpson originally rose to fame as a football standout. After winning the 1968 Heisman Trophy at the University of Southern California, he was selected by the Buffalo Bills as the No. 1 overall pick in the 1969 draft. Simpson retired from the NFL in 1979 after playing 11 seasons, pivoting his career to take […] O.J Simpson’s Alleged Infidelity\n\nThroughout the first two episodes, numerous people accused O.J. of being unfaithful. The names being thrown around included actress Tawny Kitaen, who mentioned in archival interviews that she met O.J. when he was married to Nicole. (Their affair was officially uncovered during the civil trial for Nicole’s wrongful death.) “When Nicole was giving birth to her second child, he had someone over at the house. Judi [Brown] was aware of his cheating. She told me who these people were. As Nicole became aware of his cheating, it disturbed her more and more,” family friend Manton claimed. “When she was in the hospital giving birth [to Justin], her husband had someone in her house and there were pictures of Nicole all over. He simply put them face down so the woman wouldn’t see them. [It] was sick.” Denise, for her part, recalled driving around with Nicole looking for houses that allegedly belonged to O.J.’s flings. Nicole Brown Simpson’s Attempt to Leave O.J Simpson The second episode picked up when the police got involved on New Year’s 1989. A 911 call played where Nicole could be heard speaking about the abuse. Footage from the civil trial testimonies showed Cowlings asking for a break after getting visually emotional at photos of Nicole’s injuries from that night. Detective John Edwards testified about what took place in 1989 at the criminal trial for Nicole’s murder years later. “This is a 911 radio call. According to the comments, the operator could hear a woman being beaten over the phone,” Edwards noted. “She collapsed and started yelling, ‘He is going to kill me.’ She had a cut approximately one-inch on her left lip. She had a swollen right forehead and her left eye was starting to blacken. She had a hand imprint on her throat.” Edwards photographed Nicole’s injuries, which were shown on screen. Denise said Nicole asked her to take photos as evidence as well days after the incident. Despite the abuse, Nicole’s mother encouraged her not to leave O.J. over “episodes of bad behavior” so their family could remain intact. There were letters featured in the doc where O.J. apologized to Nicole for harming her in 1989. “I think she wanted everything to work so bad,” Domonique noted. “That’s why she continued getting back together with him because she hoped it would be what she expected it to be.” It took a few more years — until 1992 — for Nicole to decide to leave O.J. She asked friend Robin Greer to help her find a home and break the news to O.J. As their marriage was coming to an end, rumors started to surface about Nicole’s alleged affair with O.J.’s friend Marcus Allen. “It was one of those relationships that turned from he was comforting her through her divorce and I think it was a natural thing that shouldn’t have happened.” Resnick recalled. “It was very hard to understand why she would go down that road. She felt like he had taken so much from her that she didn’t owe him anything. I was nervous for her.” After her split from O.J., he allegedly kept stalking and visiting her house. Nicole made multiple 911 calls to report the incidents. “He was kind of spying on her a lot. Because he was realizing that she was becoming happy. He was like stalking and hiding in the bushes. Actually in the bushes,” Resnick shared. “She would say, ‘Be careful what you say. He could be right next to us. I saw him last night in a bush. I don’t want to get him upset because he is watching all the time.'” A 911 phone call from 1993 showed Nicole screaming for help as O.J. yelled at her for having a man named Keith over. O.J. accused Nicole in the audio of kissing Keith, which he saw while watching her from outside her home. House guest Brian “Kato” Kaelin, who was heavily involved in Nicole’s murder trial, shared his side of the story as someone who lived with Nicole amid her split from O.J. “When an argument was happening or was brewing, I could sense it. The kids would come to my room sometimes,” Kaelin noted before addressing the 1993 incident. “I was coming back home. I got to the house and the doors of her house were broken. The hinges were broken.” Los Angeles police officer Spencer Marks was on the scene in 1993, sharing in the doc, “She told me that there had been ongoing problems. Then she said, ‘I know for a fact he is going to murder me one day.'” Nicole ultimately reconciled with O.J. because she knew his behavior wouldn’t stop. “She says, ‘He is never going to leave me alone. I am never going to get rid of him. I might as well go back to him,'” Denise shared. “Those were her words to me.” The duo called it quits for good by May 1994 but Nicole was still scared of O.J. Da’Anna specifically recounted a conversation she had with Nicole before her death. “Nicole said that she had fears of being attacked from behind and being slashed by a knife,” she detailed. “Couple of years down the road when they were having really difficult times, she said, ‘Whenever we have these big fights, he would say to me I am going to chop you up on little pieces and bury you up on Mulholland and no one will know where you are. Not even your children.'” Related: O.J. Simpson's 'Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' Connection Explained O.J.

When we met, it was a really fast friendship because Robert [Kardashian] and O.J. were so close. One of my best memories of Nicole was when she would climb up on the roof at Christmas time and do her own lights,” Jenner shared. “That would amaze me and I would run home and try to do my own Christmas lights because I thought, ‘If she can do it, I can do it.'” The reality star continued: “I think Nicole was really careful and she didn’t befriend everybody.

            "summary": "‘It was truly Catholic, and it was a heroic talk, where he uplifted the role of wife and mother, and he uplifted the role of true masculinity of men and asked men to step up and take responsibility for their families,’ Dan Donaldson said.\n\nThe May 11 Benedictine College commencement address by NFL kicker Harrison Butker caused a clamor across the country, with its traditional Catholic themes drawing criticism as well as praise.\n\nDan Donaldson, vice president of Heroic Men and the Catholic Men’s Leadership Alliance, in light of the upcoming Heroic Leadership Summit June 28-30 at Christ Cathedral, in Anaheim, California, on Wednesday shared with the Register his thoughts about Butker’s speech and how its expressed values relate to these organizations’ priorities.\n\nDan Donaldson, vice president of Heroic Men and the Catholic Men’s Leadership Alliance (Photo: Courtesy of Dan Donaldson)\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, please set the stage with a thumbnail sketch of Heroic Men.\n\nHeroic Men is powered by the Catholic Men’s Leadership Alliance. Who doesn’t want to be a heroic man? Our motto is “Strengthen the man, strengthen the family. Strengthen the family, strengthen the Church. Strengthen the Church, transform the culture.”\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether it was Harrison Butker or someone else with the same message treated that way, what should people do before reacting?\n\nWhat I want to encourage people to do whenever there is an uproar about something — whether it be Harrison Butcher’s speech, whether it be a comment made by the Pope, whether it be a papal encyclical, whenever there’s some controversy — is: Go to the source. First of all, go to the actual source. I encourage people to listen to Harrison Butker’s talk. Don’t count on the media. Go to the source. [You can read the full text here.] It was a very Catholic talk at an ardently Catholic university that is on fire and really growing.\n\nIf you can YouTube it, listen to the audience’s response. I don’t think they were upset. They were applauding. They were completely, completely agreeing with what Harrison Butker said. Why? Because they’re Catholic. He spoke about truth. And to people that know the truth, the truth will set us free — if we’re open to it. If we’re not open to it, then we’re probably going to rail against it and try to fight it.\n\nSo here’s what I see about Harrison Butker’s speech: It was truly Catholic, and it was a heroic talk, where he uplifted the role of wife and mother, and he uplifted the role of true masculinity of men and asked men to step up and take responsibility for their families.\n\nIt takes people of courage to step up and say the things that Harrison Butker said. And we need to be prepared to get the response that he got.\n\nHow would you describe the reaction to Butker’s speech?\n\nA lot of the media consternation was about this thinking that he denigrated women. No, he uplifted women. My wife’s a homemaker. We have five kids ranging down [in age] from 31 to 14. And one of the things that she struggled with throughout her life is feeling second-class, feeling like the culture was not supportive of what she’s done to raise our children and be there for our family, which is her primary vocation. The culture says, “No, you got to go out and do all these other things.” If you chase two rabbits through the forest, it’s really hard to catch either one of them.\n\nAnd I just love what Harrison Butcher said to really honor the role of mothers. So we’re in full support. And he really also asked men to step up to the plate and take on spiritual leadership of their homes. So we’re fully, fully supportive of that.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you see as some high points in his speech that easily relate to Heroic Men and the Catholic Men’s Leadership Alliance?\n\nTwo things: leadership and authentic masculinity. We need true leaders in our Church today; true leaders that are willing to stand up and speak the truth, even when it’s inconvenient.\n\nHarrison Butker spoke of bishops and priests that need to be those true leaders. What I’d like to say to that is, in order for those bishops and priests to be true leaders, we need to encourage them, and support them, and love them, and give them their proper authority. We need to step up and support our priests and our bishops and let them know we’ve got their backs. That’s so important. Before we criticize, we need to make sure that they know that they are loved and they are supported, and they do not have to cave into cultural forces because they have got a family behind them that’s going to support them to be authentically Catholic. Let’s start there.\n\nSecond thing: authentic masculinity. Harrison Butker’s beaming in on authentic masculinity. I love what he had to say. He’s a football player and an entrepreneur. But first, he’s a husband and a father. Our vocation is not how we make money. Our vocation is our role in the vocation that God has called us to, whether that be as a husband or a single man. We need to focus on that vocation first, and then our roles need to be supportive of that.\n\nI love what he said about his wife: that she helps him to stay reined in so that he can have that true focus as a husband and a father. That’s his primary vocation. And he made that loud and clear, and he was emotional about it. Would that we would all get emotional thinking about that. And behave in the same way. And be truly, authentically masculine by first standing up for our families. It doesn’t start with standing up and being successful in our careers. That’s important, too. Don’t negate that. They go together. But there’s a primacy of place. We must have a primacy of place in our vocation.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat else stood out for you?\n\nHis view of women and their role. Let’s just repeat it: Essentially, he was actually celebrating the role of wife and mother. Does that mean our wives can’t work outside the home? No, they absolutely can. If that’s something that works for the family, fine. But what comes first? He’s celebrating the role of wife and mother first. He’s not saying don’t go out, have a successful career. There are some people that can do that. My mom was one of them. My mom was a single mom of five kids before she married my stepfather when I was 4 years old. She was a very successful businesswoman, but she was also a good mom. The reason why she ran her businesses was to support her family. Her primary vocation was mom, was wife. And my dad’s primary vocation was husband and father.\n\nMy dad was there for me. He was a sports editor at a local newspaper. He worked his tail off. He was at work every morning at 6 a.m. But his day didn’t end at 3 p.m. It really started. That’s when he would pick me up from school and take me to baseball practice. He was my baseball coach. Then, after that, he would take me to swim practice. He was there for our family. So I digress a little bit, personally, but there it is right there: Butker was celebrating the roles of mothers, of wives and mothers. Focus on that first, and everything else will come all into place.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nHeroicMen.com\n\nCatholicMenLeaders.org",

            "title": "Men Should Be Homemakers, Too | Darren Geist",
            "summary": "The Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker has been subject to a chorus of condemnation after his commencement speech at Benedictine College. The critics have particularly denounced Butker’s claim that his wife believes “her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother,” embracing “one of the most important titles of all: homemaker.” As a life-long self-described feminist, perhaps I, too, should be offended by this—but I’m in such agreement with the priorities Butker espouses that I recently left my job as a senior attorney for a Fortune 500 company to temporarily be a full-time stay-at-home dad.\n\nNot only is Butker’s message about the importance of “homemaking” and family life worth hearing, but it also applies as much to men as it does to women. Butker correctly points out that “football” and “business” should not be a “distraction” from being a father and a husband. And this for a simple universal truth: Your family matters far more than your job.\n\nMy work as an attorney is in a different category than my vocation as a father. For Catholics like Butker and myself, a vocation is not a mere job. It is a calling or mission to serve God in a particular way, and it transforms and remains with us the rest of our lives. Very few careers are also vocations. Jobs can come and go. We can quit and find something better. Even in my highly competitive position, I was fundamentally replaceable. But I am irreplaceable to my family. Whatever influence I’ve had as an attorney pales in comparison to how I affect my family by simply being present for them and, in the case of my kids, showing them the love that only a father can. The rote tasks at work are replaced at home by menial tasks that build a foundation of love and security for my children.\n\nLike Butker's wife, I found that my life started anew with my children. My first daughter and my fatherhood came into existence at the same time; they are inextricably bound together. And in her creation, my vocation as a father was created as well. My identity has been fundamentally transformed: I will be a father forever to my children, and I am powerless to end that mission and that purpose. My only choice is between doing it well and doing it poorly.\n\nIt is easier for men to use careers as an excuse to be absent from home, for the burdens of pregnancy and parenthood are uniquely borne by women. Though I give up a lot for my children, it is incomparable to the sacrifices my wife made through the challenges and seeming indignities of pregnancy and labor, let alone the task of caring for a new infant whom she literally sustains with her body. But if we want men to be better fathers and husbands, we can’t simply condemn their absence; we have to also extoll the virtues of marriage, parenthood, and, yes, homemaking.\n\n“Homemaking” is often considered less valuable, less fulfilling, and less important than a career. But precisely the reverse is true. A homemaker is not a house maid, but an educator and the architect who builds the moral foundation for what Catholics refer to as the domestic church. That responsibility is as noble and important as any, and much harder than most. The original feminists, like Mary Wollstonecraft and others, pushed for women to have careers and political influence, but they never denigrated the primacy of home life and motherhood. Rather, they saw motherhood as fostering precisely those virtues our society needs, and they called for men to lead equally virtuous lives, with home always at the center.\n\nAs the company I worked for began to be less family-friendly, my wife and I had our fourth child and began to homeschool the older ones. It was no longer possible to be the employee my workplace wanted and the husband and father my family needed. My career was the appropriate sacrifice, and I decided to walk away from it for a while. I was incredibly blessed with the freedom to do this. And my parents had also set an example for me. For non-religious reasons, my mother had turned away from her promising career to homeschool her three sons, and my dad rejected numerous career advancement opportunities to spend more time at home. They modeled for me the value of putting family life first, and sacrificing much for it. For that, I am very grateful, and I hope to model the same for my children—to show them that our career choices should be ordered, as much as possible, to serve our family.\n\nSome have asked why Butker delivered this message at a graduation ceremony. But it is precisely new graduates who should hear it: Keep your priorities in their proper place, lest you chase the lesser good at the expense of the greater one. Butker should not be criticized for speaking that simple truth out loud.\n\nDarren Geist is a practicing attorney.\n\nFirst Things depends on its subscribers and supporters.

Didn’t work,” Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said.\n\nJustin Martínez (2-0) tossed two hitless innings and Paul Sewald, pitching on consecutive days for the first time this year, got three outs for his fifth save.\n\n“It’s a big win,” Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said. “We’re going to feel good about traveling back to AZ and sleep well.”\n\nNew York (24-35) fell 11 games under .500, matching its season high, and finished a 3-7 homestand against three NL West opponents. The Mets have not won a series since a two-game, rain-shortened sweep at St. Louis on May 6-7 and have not won a home series since sweeping three games against Pittsburgh from April 15-17.\n\nFans booed loudly when Mark Vientos hit a game-ending popout.\n\n\"We've got to play better, especially here at home, especially in front of our fan base,\" Mendoza said.\n\nDefending NL champion Arizona won its second straight after a five-game losing streak. The Diamondbacks got solo homers from two of their first three batters against Quintana. Marte hit his fourth leadoff homer this year and the ninth of his career, and Lourdes Gurriel Jr. also went deep. Kevin Newman added an RBI grounder in the second for a 3-0 lead.\n\nQuintana allowed four runs, three hits, three walks and two hit batters in four innings, raising his ERA to 5.17. He is winless in his past nine starts and has allowed 11 homers in 12 outings this season, up from five over 13 games in his injury-shortened 2023 season.\n\nPfaadt gave up four runs and five hits in six innings.\n\nGiven a three-run lead, Pfaadt allowed Tyrone Taylor’s leadoff double in the third, a walk and Pete Alonso’s RBI single. Nimmo hit a drive to right-center that drove in two runs when right fielder Randal Grichuk just missed on his attempt for a diving backhand catch. Martinez followed two pitches later with a drive off the wall. Corbin Carroll, playing in shallow center, couldn’t sprint back quickly enough.\n\nNew York had three triples in the series after hitting one in its first 55 games.\n\nNew catcher Luis Torrens, acquired from the Yankees on Friday, went 0 for 2 with a walk in his Mets debut.\n\nTRAINER’S ROOM\n\nDiamondbacks: SS Geraldo Perdomo (right meniscus tear) will play a third game in the Arizona Complex League on Monday, then could shift his rehab assignment to Triple-A Reno. ... OF Alek Thomas (strained left hamstring) still isn’t ready for a minor league rehab assignment. ... LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (strained shoulder) is being progressed slowly in throwing on flat ground. Lovullo said a timeline for a return could be before or after the All-Star break.\n\nMets: C Francisco Alvarez (left thumb surgery) caught for the second straight day at Double-A Binghamton, playing seven innings and going 1 for 3. He could be activated for next weekend’s series against Philadelphia in London or for the homestand that opens June 11.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nDiamondbacks: RHP Ryne Nelson (3-4, 6.02 ERA) starts at home Monday night against San Francisco.\n\nMets: RHP Tylor Megill (0-2, 1.69 ERA) starts Monday night’s series opener at Washington, which opens with LHP MacKenzie Gore (4-4, 2.91).\n\n------\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",

            "title": "MLB Scores: Diamondbacks 5, Mets 4—Mets suffer another crushing defeat",
            "summary": "The Mets came into the final game of the series against the Diamondbacks looking for a win. They had not won a series at home since April, and they had two good games to start the series. José Quintana was starting for the Mets and he’s been struggling a bit this year,especially with home runs. But Brandon Pfaadt, the Diamondbacks starter, was also not lighting the world on fire, so it was a winnable game. It was also Lou Gehrig Day, which celebrates Gehrig’s life and career while also raising awareness for ALS, the disease that tragically took his life.\n\nQuintana looked shaky to start things off. He gave up a home run to Ketel Marte to lead off the game with a one-run deficit. Two batters later Lourdes Gurriel Jr. hit a one-out home run to double the Diamondbacks’ lead. Quintana got out of his mess after that but the Mets were immediately attempting a comeback. In the bottom of the first, Brandon Pfaadt sent the Mets down in order, keeping the Mets down two runs.\n\nThe second inning was not an improvement on the first for Quintana. Eugenio Suárez led off with a walk, and Blaze Alexander doubled to put two runners in scoring position. Kevin Newman grounded out but that brought in the third run for the Diamondbacks. Other than hitting Ketel Marte with a pitch with two outs, Quintana escaped the inning without giving up another run. In the bottom of the inning, the Mets struck out three times in a row, keeping them behind.\n\nThe top of the third was, comparatively, better for Quintana. He didn’t allow any runs, and other than hitting Randal Grichuk with a pitch, he got three outs fairly quickly. The Mets found some offense in the bottom of the third. Tyrone Taylor led off with a double, and moved to third on a Jeff McNeil fly out. New Met Luis Torrens walked to put two runners on the corners. Lindor lined out to Newman for the second out, but a Pete Alonso single drove in Taylor for the Mets first run and moved Torrens to second. Brandon Nimmo then hit a triple to center, driving in both Torrens and Alonso to tie the game. Then J.D. Martinez hit another triple to drive in Nimmo and give the Mets the lead. DJ Stewart struck out to end the inning but the Mets had found themselves with a skinny one run lead a third of the way through the game.\n\nQuintana had another busy inning in the fourth. Kevin Newman hit a one-out single to put a runner on, then Ketel Marte and Carroll drew back-to-back walks to load the bases with two outs. But Gurriel flew out to end the inning before Quintana could relinquish the Mets’ lead. In the bottom of the inning a Mark Vientos leadoff walk led nowhere as Taylor popped out and McNeil grounded into a double play.\n\nThe Mets made a pitching change before the start of the fifth, bringing in Dedniel Núñez to take over from Quintana. And it paid off, as other than a one-out Grichuk double, the Diamondbacks were unable to get anything going offensively. Similarly, the Mets were quiet in the bottom of the fifth, going down in order.\n\nAfter getting Newman to strike out to start the sixth, the Mets made a pitching change, bringing in Danny Young after Núñez got four outs. And other than a Ketel Marte double, Young similarly shut down the Diamondbacks. In the bottom of the sixth, the Mets were quiet, other than a DJ Stewart two-out double, and the Mets were continuing to hold a small one run lead into the final third of the game (which is a statement that has produced a lot of horror shows for the Mets over the last few weeks).\n\nReed Garrett came in to pitch in the top of the seventh, and the Mets also kept Harrison Bader (who pinch-ran for Stewart the previous inning) in to play center field, shifting Taylor to right field. Garrett had a big inning, getting three strikeouts to set the side down in order, impressive especially with his struggles as of late. The Diamondbacks brought in Justin Martinez to pitch in the bottom of the seventh, ending Pfaadt’s day after six innings. The Mets hit three consecutive groundouts, ending the inning quickly.\n\nAdam Ottavino came in to pitch the eighth inning. He looked incredibly sharp, striking out two in a perfect inning, keeping the Mets in the lead with just one more inning to go. In the bottom of the inning the Mets did nothing, with Lindor, Alonso, and Nimmo all striking out. The Mets had to just get three more outs without giving up a run to win their first series at home since April.\n\nJake Diekman came in to try and get the save for the Mets…and it didn’t quite work out. Gabriel Moreno came in to pinch-hit for Tucker Barnhart, and he led off with a double. Then Ketel Marte capped off a great day with a two-run, go-ahead home run. Diekman got Carroll to ground out for the first out, then Mendoza brought in Sean Reid-Foley to try and close out the inning. He got the job done, despite a two-out single, and the Mets were faced with having to try and win this game with just three outs to work with. And they would have to do it against former Met Paul Sewald. And two pop outs and a strikeout later, the Mets had lost to the Diamondbacks.\n\nThe Mets split with the Diamondbacks, but the obvious issues with the team persist. They have starting pitching that tends to either not be able to go long or give up a ton of runs (and sometimes both), their offense is inconsistent and the veterans especially have been struggling for large swaths of the season, and their bullpen is fatigued from having to make up for the starters’ flaws and is beginning to show large cracks. It’s still early, but the further they slip in the wild card standings, the harder it will be to catch up at a certain point. The National League as a whole is not fantastic this year, but the Mets look to be a bottom rung team in a weak league.\n\nSB Nation GameThreads\n\nAmazin’ Avenue\n\nAZ Snake Pit\n\nBox scores\n\nMLB.com\n\nESPN\n\nWin Probability Added\n\nWhat’s WPA?\n\nBig Mets winner: Brandon Nimmo, +19.9% WPA\n\nBig Mets loser: Jake Diekman, -67.6% WPA\n\nMets pitchers: -42.9% WPA\n\nMets hitters: -7.1% WPA\n\nTeh aw3s0mest play: Brandon Nimmo’s 2 RBI triple in the third, +23.5% WPA\n\nTeh sux0rest play: Ketel Marte’s two-run home run in the ninth, -49.2% WPA",

Mandatory Credit: Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports\n\nKetel Marte had a 21-game hitting streak earlier this season and a stretch of 22 hitless at-bats late last month.\n\nThe Arizona star is back on the upswing and looks to follow up a big effort when the Diamondbacks face the San Francisco Giants on Monday in the opener of a three-game set in Phoenix.\n\nMarte went 3-for-3 with two homers, three RBIs and two runs in Sunday's 5-4 road victory over the New York Mets. He also walked and was hit by a pitch on a day in which he had the seventh multi-homer game of his career.\n\nIt was a sudden turnaround from a deep slump to putting on a power show. Marte was retired in his first at-bat of the series on Thursday for failed at-bat No. 22 in a row, but he said he didn't let his troubles consume him.\n\n\"It's a long season, and I never give up,\" Marte said. \"I'm the guy that works hard every day no matter what happens. Right now, I'm just trying to help my team. We're just looking to win a game, and I know that they need me out there.\"\n\nMarte has hit .270 with 12 homers and 32 RBIs in 58 games this season. He is tied for the team lead in home runs with Christian Walker.\n\n\"He's so incredibly talented,\" Arizona closer Paul Sewald said of Marte. \"When he's on, he's on like nobody in the league.\"\n\nMarte was certainly \"on\" during the Diamondbacks' run to the World Series last season. He batted .329 in 17 playoff games, getting at least one hit in each of the first 16 contests.\n\nArizona expects to return to the postseason this year. But even after two straight wins against New York to halt a five-game slide, the Diamondbacks are five games below .500.\n\nSan Francisco has dropped four straight games, with Sunday's 7-5 home loss to the New York Yankees proving especially painful.\n\nThe Yankees scored four runs in the ninth against Giants closer Camilo Doval to leave San Francisco 2-4 on a six-game homestand.\n\n\"I felt good with Doval. Anytime he's in the game, we feel good,\" Giants manager Bob Melvin said. \"He's had a couple of tough ones this year, but especially in those save situations, those are the ones that inspire him.\"\n\n\"... I'll take him against anybody. They just got him (Sunday).\"\n\nHeliot Ramos homered and had three RBIs and Casey Schmitt also went deep and drove in two runs in the loss.\n\nRight-hander Ryne Nelson (3-4, 6.02 ERA) will start Monday's series opener for the Diamondbacks.\n\nNelson pitched two scoreless innings against San Francisco on April 18 but had to leave after Mike Yastrzemski's line drive hit his pitching elbow. Nelson went on the 15-day injured list the following day and made his next appearance on May 5.\n\nNelson has lost two of his past three outings, including Wednesday's against the Rangers, as Texas roughed him up for four runs on five hits in six innings.\n\nNelson is 1-0 with a 3.10 ERA in four career starts against the Giants.\n\nSan Francisco hasn't announced a starter and is expected to go the bullpen route. Right-hander Spencer Howard could be one of the pitchers. Howard threw four innings of scoreless relief against the Philadelphia Phillies on Tuesday in his first big-league outing of the season.",

            "title": "'Good start': Hayes' USWNT era begins with win over South Korea",
            "summary": "ESPN's Jeff Kassouf reacts to the USWNT's 4-0 victory over South Korea and offers analysis of how much of an impact new coach Emma Hayes already has on this squad. (1:56)\n\nCOMMERCE CITY, Colorado -- If the United States women's national team's 4-0 win over South Korea on Saturday at Dick's Sporting Goods Park was any indication, the stagnant attack from last year's World Cup is fully an issue of the past.\n\nThe era of Emma Hayes as USWNT coach got off to a slow first half-hour before forward Sophia Smith turned quickly and slotted a ball to winger Mallory Swanson for the first goal of the match in the 34th minute. Swanson made a slashing run behind South Korea's back five and tucked the ball away for her first of two goals on the night in a play that exemplified both the team's patience and the front line's fluidity.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\n\n\"I think something that's really good about Emma's style and the way that she wants us to be fluid in our structured principles, so I think she gives us a lot of freedom,\" USWNT midfielder Catarina Macario said after the match.\n\nMacario played the No. 10 role on Saturday in her first start for the national team in 781 days. She pressed into high areas alongside Smith, the USWNT's No. 9, as the USWNT built attacks with five players across the front line at times. Macario also frequently flared out to wide areas to find the game. Swanson would shift inside at times, too, and she moved into the No. 9 role late in the match after a series of substitutions. Trinity Rodman rounded out the front four for the USWNT with her usual persistent effort on both sides of the ball on the right wing. The interchange between those four players specifically is a welcomed sign for a team that was too rigid -- a word Hayes used recently to describe what the team must avoid -- at the 2023 World Cup, where the USWNT's round of 16 exit marked the program's worst finish at a major tournament.\n\nSwanson and Macario were both absent from that squad due to injury. Swanson was arguably one of the best players in the world before tearing her left patella tendon last spring, and former USWNT head coach Vlatko Andonovski was developing Macario as the focal point of the attack in 2022 before Macario tore her left ACL. Hayes now has the benefit of those two players healthy, not to mention the luxury of bringing Crystal Dunn, Rose Lavelle and Jaedyn Shaw off the bench in the second half to add fresh legs to the attack.\n\nShaw, 19, is the USWNT's leading scorer this year and one of the most versatile and creative attacking players in the pool. On Saturday, Shaw played primarily in a left-wing role alongside Swanson.\n\nHayes said on Friday that she divides her coaching responsibilities like American sports teams do, with different coaches specializing in different areas of the game. The attacking third is her responsibility, so Saturday's front line was a first look at how a USWNT pool loaded with scoring talent might operate with Hayes now on the sidelines, following a six-month waiting period while she finished the European season at Chelsea.\n\nThe new head coach praised her team's ability to process a lot of new information this week, but she stressed on Saturday that there is room to improve. The Americans were slow and, at times, disjointed in the first 30 minutes on Saturday. South Korea earned an early corner kick and got near goal only as a byproduct of the Americans' mistakes. The USWNT eventually settled into the match, and the opening goal came from a patient spell of possession that ended with center back Naomi Girma on the ball in an advanced position. She played Smith, who turned and quickly slotted Swanson for the goal.\n\n\"In terms what I had asked from the group, what we prepared for, the execution of that -- we've made steps in the right direction,\" Hayes said. \"I felt for the first 30 minutes, it was technical execution where we struggled. We scored in our first three chances, so we were efficient, we were clinical.\"\n\nShe added that \"there's another level\" still to be reached by Smith, particularly in her combination play with Swanson.\n\nEmma Hayes, right, successfully navigated her first game in charge of the USWNT, defeating South Korea 4-0. Brad Smith/ISI Photos/USSF/Getty Images\n\nThe USWNT faces South Korea again on Tuesday in St. Paul, Minnesota, in the team's final match before Hayes must choose her 18-player Olympic roster. She is spoiled with attacking talent to choose from, and each decision she makes about how to set up the front line has a knock-on effect on the rest of the positions. Alex Morgan reaffirmed her role as the team's No. 9 earlier this year, but Morgan did not play on Saturday. Hayes called it a precaution due to pelvic tightness in training on Friday, noting that the staff wanted to play a \"nice and fresh\" Morgan on Tuesday.\n\nSmith has long been the other natural option in that striker role, but last year she was shoehorned into a wide role next to Morgan and the entire front line struggled at the World Cup. Smith's central presence on Saturday underscored why that is her best role.\n\nRodman remains ever reliable, having played in every USWNT match since the start of 2023. She was active throughout Saturday's match, sparking passing sequences after regaining the ball in deep areas and getting to the end line to serve crosses.\n\nMacario is the maverick within the group. She is a generational player who can thrive as a No. 10 with freedom, or she can pull out defenses as a striker.\n\n\"I have hindsight because I've coached her at club level, so I know how she operates in pockets,\" Hayes said. \"She can draw players in, she can escape pressure -- she's a quite press-resistant player, links really well.\"\n\nHayes said that she \"really enjoyed the front four in the first half.\"\n\n\"Fluidity\" is a common way to describe Hayes' tactics, and that was on display in attack on Saturday. Hayes, however, has also consistently tempered expectations, stressing the need for processes. She's pragmatic -- and she isn't nearly satisfied yet.\n\n\"I think you can see we're building something,\" Hayes said. \"There's lots of work to do. There's lots of holes in our play, no question, but it was a good start.\"",

            "summary": "COMMERCE CITY, Colo. (June 1, 2024) – The U.S. Women’s National Team opened the Emma Hayes era with an entertaining show of attacking prowess and rode braces from forward Mallory Swanson and defender Tierna Davidson to a dominant 4-0 victory over Korea Republic. The first win for Hayes as head coach of the USWNT was part of an historic women’s soccer doubleheader which began with an 11-0 win for the U.S. Women’s Deaf National Team over Australia.\n\nThe match was played in front of an enthusiastic sold-out crowd of 19,010 at Dick’s Sporting Goods Park, which saw all three of their home state heroes play big roles, with Swanson (Highlands Ranch, Colo.) scoring twice, Sophia Smith (Windsor, Colo.) terrorizing the Korean defense while picking up an assist and Lindsey Horan (Golden, Colo.) captaining the team.\n\nIt took the USA a few minutes find a good attacking rhythm in Hayes’ highly anticipated debut match against a Korean side that was playing with five defenders and dropping deep. Midfielder Catarina Macario’s effort from distance 12 minutes in forced Kim Jung-Mi into an awkward kick save, but that was the one quality look at goal in the early going. Minutes later, Swanson forced another save out of Kim and midfielder Sam Coffey smashed a shot from just outside the penalty area wide right of the frame.\n\nThe USA went in front in the 34th minute and the goal came through the central corridor thanks to a Colorado connection. Macario’s unlocking ball found Sophia Smith at the top of the penalty box, where she took a settling touch before slipping a ball to Swanson inside the area. Her first-time finish just inside the right post made for the most fitting of openers in front of the packed crowd, which would not have to wait long for more.\n\nHoran forced Kim into a diving parry just three minutes later and the ensuing corner kick by Macario from the right found Davidson at the far corner of the six-yard box. The defender’s looping header dipped just underneath the crossbar for her second career international goal, her first coming nearly six years ago on August 31, 2018.\n\nAfter scoring just once in her previous 57 caps for the USWNT, Davidson got greedy in the best way possible to open the second half scoring. Like her first two international goals, the center back scored with her head off a corner kick, this time meeting Swanson’s service inside the six to push the advantage to 3-0 just three minutes into the half. The unlikely scorer became the first USWNT defender to score twice in a game since Julie Ertz accomplished the feat with a pair of set piece finishes of her own against Colombia on April 10, 2016.\n\nSwanson finished off her brace in the 74th minute and it was the sixth two-goal game of her international career and second for the USWNT in her home state of Colorado. Second half substitute Rose Lavelle, who earned her 99th USWNT cap when she came on as part of a quartet of subs at the hour mark, stole a pass in midfield and sprinted toward the penalty area before laying the ball off to Swanson. The 34th goal of Swanson’s international career capped the scoring.\n\nBetween the posts, goalkeeper Jane Campbell earned her eighth cap – and first since October 2021, also against Korea Republic – and had light work to do to earn her fifth career shutout. Defender Sam Staab will be known as the first player to make her debut under Emma Hayes. The 27-year-old’s entrance for Davidson in the 61st minute made her the 249th player all-time to earn a cap for the USWNT and the first to do so in 2024.\n\nThe USA and Korea Republic will renew acquaintances quickly, with a rematch set for Allianz Field in St. Paul, Minn. on June 4 in a match presented by Allstate. Kickoff in the Twin Cities is set for 7 p.m. local / 8 p.m. ET.\n\nGOAL SCORING RUNDOWN:\n\nUSA – Mallory Swanson (Sophia Smith),34th minute: A long spell of possession in the final third resulted in Macario being able to finally break Korea Republic’s low block with a splitting pass from the edge of the final third to Smith. A gathering touch at the top of the area set Smith up to slip a ball that found the diagonal run of Swanson, who finished inside the right post from 13 yards out to open the scoring. USA 1, KOR 0\n\nUSA – Tierna Davidson (Catarina Macario),38th minute: Lindsey Horan’s saved shot from distance set up Smith’s inswinger from the right corner, which Davidson met over a defender at the far corner of the six-yard box. Her looping header denying the thin air, dipping just enough to get under the crossbar into the right corner to quickly double the advantage. USA 2, KOR 0\n\nUSA – Tierna Davidson (Mallory Swanson),48th minute: Swanson added an assist to her ledger on the scoresheet with a fine service from the corner that found an unmarked Davidson just inside the six. With Kim off her line, Davidson’s header took a solid bounce off the turf and went past multiple defenders inside the six for her second of the match. USA 3, KOR 0\n\nUSA – Mallory Swanson (Rose Lavelle),34th minute: Dogged defensive effort by substitute Crystal Dunn helped force a loose pass by Korea Republic out of their final third, which Lavelle intercepted near midfield. Lavelle’s driving run into the final third drew enough defenders to allow space for Swanson to run her ball into the right side of the area, where she finished across her body with a low effort inside the left post for her second of the evening. USA 4, KOR 0\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES:\n\nWith her winning debut, Hayes – the fourth woman and 10th full-time head coach overall in program history –became the eighth coach to open their permanent tenure with a win. The four-goal margin tied her with Pia Sundhage (also a 4-0 victor in 2008) for the second-largest win by a full-time head coach in their first match with the USWNT, the duo eclipsed only by Tony DiCicco’s 5-0 result in 1995.\n\nToday’s triumph kept the USA undefeated all-time against Korea Republic, pushing the series record to 12W-0L-4D. The USA also remained unbeaten all-time in Colorado, improving to 8W-0L-1D in matches played in the Centennial State.\n\nTierna Davidson’s goal was her first goal for the USWNT in 2,101 days. Her only other goal for the USWNT also came on a header off a corner kick, that on August 31, 2018, when she was 19-years old.\n\nMallory Swanson’s goal in the 34th minute was her first in 465 days for the USWNT. She last scored against Brazil on Feb. 22, 2023, in the SheBelieves Cup finale.\n\nSwanson’s brace was the sixth of her international career and her second for the USWNT in her home state of Colorado, also scoring twice the USWNT’s victory over Australia at Dick’s Sporting Goods Park on April 4, 2019.\n\nSwanson’s three goal involvements (two goals, one assist) are tied for the second-most in a game in her international career. This is her eighth career game for the USWNT with at least one goal and one assist.\n\nSophia Smith’s assist to Swanson was the ninth of her career and her second of 2024.\n\nCatarina Macario’s assist on Tierna Davidson’s goal in the 38th minute was the third assist of her international career and marked Macario’s first goal involvement for the USWNT in 781 days, when she tallied a brace in her most recent start before today during the the USA’s April 12, 2022 win against Uzbekistan.\n\nMacario returned to the field for the USWNT on April 6 during the 2024 SheBelieves Cup for her first international appearance since tearing her ACL at the end of the 2021-22 season with Olympique Lyon.\n\n- U.S. WOMENS NATIONAL TEAM MATCH REPORT -\n\nMatch: United States Women’s National Team vs. Korea Republic\n\nDate: June 1, 2024\n\nCompetition: International Friendly\n\nVenue: Dick’s Sporting Goods Park; Commerce City, Colo.\n\nAttendance: 19,010\n\nKickoff: 5:07 p.m. ET (3:07 p.m. local)\n\nWeather: 81 degrees, partly cloudy\n\nScoring Summary 1 2 F USA 2 2 4 KOR 0 0 0\n\nUSA - Mallory Swanson (Sophia Smith) 34th minute USA - Tierna Davidson (Catarina Macario) 38 USA - Tierna Davidson (Mallory Swanson) 48 USA - Mallory Swanson (Rose Lavelle) 74\n\nLineups:\n\nUSA: 21-Jane Campbell; 23-Emily Fox (20-Casey Krueger, 46) 4-Naomi Girma, 12-Tierna Davidson (2-Sam Staab, 61), 3-Jenna Nighswonger; 17-Sam Coffey, 10-Lindsey Horan (Capt.)

She described the Pro Football Hall of Famer as someone who “just resonates such warmth and generosity.”\n\n“We just had a really lovely conversation about looking after human beings and doing the things we love the most, and I was fangirling. I’ve got to be honest,” Hayes said.\n\nHayes recently concluded her tenure as the longtime head coach of Chelsea Women in the Women’s Super League, where she developed a reputation as one of the leading voices for women’s football in England as well as one of the game’s most successful. Saturday marks the first time the U.S. plays under Hayes’ new management, as the senior team prepares for this summer’s Paris Olympic games.\n\nSince arriving in the U.S., Hayes has been busy meeting with some of the biggest stars in American sports, as well as Hollywood.\n\n“I’ve met Chris Pratt and Coach Prime in the space of three days,” Hayes joked to the broadcasters in the pregame broadcast on Saturday.\n\nTo that, USWNT icon Julie Foudy and current broadcaster quipped: “That’s how we roll here.”\n\n(Photo: Brad Smith / Getty Images for USSF)",

            "title": "UCSB Baseball Drops Pitcher’s Duel with Oregon, 2-1, Will Play San Diego in Elimination Game Sunday",
            "summary": "For the first time in 2024, UCSB Baseball lost at home.\n\nThe Oregon Ducks defeated the Gauchos 2-1 in a nail-biting pitchers’ duel in the winner’s bracket of the Santa Barbara Regional to hand them their first loss at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium of the season on Saturday.\n\nThe Ducks advance to the championship of the Santa Barbara Regional, while the Gauchos will play the San Diego Toreros, who eliminated Fresno State earlier on Saturday, for the second spot in the Regional championship and an opportunity for a rematch with Oregon.\n\nUCSB now needs to win three consecutive games between Sunday and Monday to win the Regional.\n\nThe Gauchos face the Toreros on Sunday at 12 p.m., while Oregon will await the winner to play at 6 p.m.\n\nShould the winner of Sunday’s 12 p.m. matchup defeat the Ducks on Sunday evening, a final game will be played Monday to determine the champion of the Santa Barbara Regional.\n\nTyler Bremner started on the mound for UCSB. In 6 ⅔ innings, Bremner allowed just one run on seven hits and two walks while striking out eight, though he did pick up Saturday’s loss.\n\nJackson Flora, Reed Moring and Matt Ager also pitched for the Gauchos, with just Flora allowing one run.\n\nGrayson Grinsell started on the mound for Oregon, throwing seven shutout innings and allowing just three hits and four walks while picking up nine strikeouts and Saturday’s win.\n\n“The changeup was good,” UCSB head coach Andrew Checketts commented on Grinsell’s performance.\n\n“We had a good game plan… If you look at his numbers, the actual amount of pitches that he throws in the [strike] zone isn’t very high. So our game plan was to try to look middle and make him come in the zone. He did a good job, he was in [the] zone more than we anticipated.”\n\nRyan Featherson celebrates the final out of Saturday’s matchup. He registered the two-inning save for the Ducks.

After Aaron Parker struck out, Brown stole third base during Nick Oakley’s plate appearance, who then drew a walk.\n\nJonah Sebring then struck out to bring Justin Trimble to the plate with runners at the corners and two outs. On an 0-2 count, Brown took off from third base in an attempt to steal home, but was thrown out to seemingly end the inning.\n\n“That was not the play we had on. We did not have steal[ing] home on. We had a play on, but not that one,” Checketts said after the game.\n\nThe umpiring crew then convened and decided to go to replay review to confirm that Grinsell stepped off the rubber of the pitcher’s mound before throwing Brown out at home.\n\nIf Grinsell kept his foot on the rubber, the throw would have been considered a pitch, and thus Oregon catcher Chase Meggers coming out of his stance to the front of the plate to apply the tag would have been illegal.\n\nHowever, after a replay review, it was determined that Grinsell did step off the mound and the out on Brown was confirmed, ending the inning.\n\nOregon also stranded five runners through six innings before scoring, two of them in scoring position.\n\nThe Ducks scored the game’s first run in the seventh inning.\n\nJustin Cassella singled up the middle with one out and stole second base during the next at-bat. In that same at-bat, Carter Garate singled up the middle to score Cassella from second base.\n\nThe Gauchos were fortunate to limit the Ducks to just that one run in the seventh inning.\n\nGarate advanced to second base on a sacrifice bunt and to third on a wild pitch. Mason Neville then drew a walk with two outs to give Oregon runners at the corners and bring Meggers to the plate.\n\nFlora threw over to third base in an unsuccessful attempt to pick off Garate and during the throw over, Neville took off for second base but was then caught in a rundown.\n\nTrimble, after receiving a throw at first base, noticed Garate taking off for home plate and ran him down all the way from first base to catch him stranded in no man’s land.\n\nTrimble went to apply the tag on Garate near home plate for the third out, but slipped and missed the tag, allowing Garate to cross home plate.\n\nHome plate umpire Javerro January, however, ruled that Garate stepped out of the basepath during the rundown and called him out to end the inning.\n\nAfter Featherston replaced Grinsell and tossed a scoreless eighth, Meggers led off the bottom half for the Ducks with a double into left field.\n\nHe was pinch-run for by Jack Brooks, who advanced to third base on a wild pitch. Brooks came around to score on Drew Smith’s groundout to Jonathan Mendez at shortstop.\n\nThe Gauchos rallied in the top of the ninth inning to give themselves a chance to win, but ultimately came up devastatingly short.\n\nParker led off the inning reaching on a first-pitch hit by pitch. Nick Oakley then drove a double into deep right field to give the Gauchos two runners in scoring position with no outs.\n\nNick Oakley came through with a big swing for the Gauchos to spark their ninth-inning rally in Saturday’s loss. (Lily Chubb / Noozhawk Photo)\n\nAfter Sebring struck out, Trimble drew a walk to load the bases with one out.\n\nWith the potential tying run on second base and go-ahead run on first base, Jonathan Mendez struck out for the inning’s second out.\n\nBrendan Durfee, who last played May 7 against Pepperdine before suffering a wrist injury, was called upon to pinch hit with the bases loaded and two outs, down 2-0.\n\nDurfee was hit by a pitch on a 1-2 count to score the Gauchos’ first run, with the umpiring crew consulting replay review to confirm the hit by pitch.\n\nWith the tying run on third base and potential lead run another 90 feet away, Ivan Brethowr grounded out to third base on the first pitch to end the game.\n\nThe Gauchos’ first of potentially two games on Sunday is scheduled for 12 p.m. against San Diego, with tickets going on sale Sunday at 9 a.m. at ucsbgauchos.com.\n\n“If any group can come back out of the losers’ bracket, it’s this group based on what they’ve done and the adversity they’ve had to go through,” Checketts said.",
