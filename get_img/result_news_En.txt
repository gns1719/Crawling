            "title": "Inside Hunter Biden's federal gun charges case in Delaware",
            "summary": "Hunter Biden's federal gun case to begin in Delaware\n\n2 hours ago Bernd Debusmann Jr , BBC News, Washington Share\n\nGetty Images Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted of the federal charges in Delaware\n\nWith the strike of a judge's gavel in Delaware, Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden, will become the first child of a sitting president to be a criminal defendant. Prosecutors allege that the younger Biden, 54, lied about his drug use on application forms when he purchased a handgun in 2018. He faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted of the three federal counts, in a case that will get under way on Monday with jury selection. Mr Biden has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The trial - which comes as his father campaigns for re-election - is likely to see prosecutors delve into graphic details of Mr Biden's crack cocaine addiction, potentially providing fodder for the president's political foes. Here is what we know about the case.\n\nWhat are the charges?\n\nMr Biden is facing three federal charges in the case: two counts of making false statements and one count of illegal gun possession. The charges all relate to his purchase of a revolver at a Delaware gun store in October 2018, which he kept for about 11 days. By Mr Biden's own admission, he was deep in the throes of a \"full blown addiction\" to crack cocaine at the time. The two false statement charges stem from allegations that he lied about his drug use on a federally-mandated form when he purchased the weapon. Specifically, prosecutors allege that he falsely claimed that he was \"not an unlawful user of and addicted to any stimulant narcotic drug\" when he purchased a Colt Cobra Special revolver. The third count is related to his possession of a firearm while alleged to have been a drug user. The gun was discarded and discovered at a grocery store in Greenville, Delaware, prompting an investigation that ultimately led investigators back to the forms.\n\nWhat evidence is there in the case?\n\nTo convict Mr Biden, prosecutors will have to convince jurors that he knowingly made false statements on the form in a bid to deceive the store that sold him the pistol. Additionally, they will have to prove that Mr Biden was a drug user or addicted to drugs, and took possession of the gun despite knowing as much. US District Judge Maryellen Noreika has already ruled that defence lawyers cannot argue that the prosecution can only get a guilty verdict by proving Mr Biden was using drugs on the day he bought the weapon. Instead, in a pre-trial hearing, the judge agreed with prosecutors' argument that they need only prove that \"unlawful use (had) occurred recently enough to indicate that the individual (was) actively engaged in such conduct\". In court filings made ahead of the trial's start, prosecutors suggested that they would rely, in part, on deeply personal text messages and other communications made while Mr Biden was in the throes of addiction. In one such text message cited in court documents, Mr Biden refers to himself as a \"liar and a thief and a blame and a user and I'm delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know\". The prosecution is also expected to rely on the testimonies of witnesses including ex-wife Kathleen Buhle and Mr Biden's ex-partner Hallie Biden - who is also the widow of Mr Biden's brother Beau. Prosecutors will also be able to point to Mr Biden's own 2021 memoir, in which he detailed his experiences as a drug user who was \"up twenty-four hours a day, smoking every 15 minutes, seven days a week\". \"All my energy revolved around smoking drugs and making arrangements to buy drugs - feeding the beast,\" he wrote in the book.\n\nGetty Images Hunter Biden has repeatedly accused Republicans of using his addiction and recovery to \"embarrass\" and attack his father\n\nWhile Mr Biden has himself been quiet about the trial, legal documents filed by his lawyers suggest that they will focus on how much Mr Biden was aware of his addiction at the end of the purchase, and on the quality of the evidence itself. His primary attorney, Abbe Lowell, has sought permission from the court to call upon an expert witness who can testify about an addict's understanding of their substance abuse issues. “Someone, like Mr Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict,” Mr Lowell wrote.\n\nInfamous laptop could feature\n\nAmong the most prominent pieces of evidence at the trial is likely to be the information on Mr Biden's infamous laptop, which has been the focus of intense media speculation and focus from conservative news outlets. The laptop has also been at the centre of unproven theories linking Mr Biden and his father to corruption, which they both deny. Mr Biden's own lawyers have argued that the computer was tampered with before it fell into the hands of investigators. The special counsel appointed to oversee the probes into Hunter Biden, David Weiss, has said that the tampering argument is a \"conspiracy theory\" with \"no supporting evidence.\" In a May filing, prosecutors wrote that the laptop contained \"significant evidence\" of Mr Biden's guilt.\n\nCould he go to prison if convicted?\n\nThe two false statement charges each carry a maximum sentence of up to 10 years, while the third count is punishable by up to five years - meaning that Mr Biden could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted. Actual sentences for federal crimes, however, are typically less than the maximum penalties specified by law. If Mr Biden is convicted, the judge in the case will ultimately determine the sentence after considering sentencing guidelines and a variety of other legal factors.\n\nHunter Biden's other charges",

            "summary": "Donald Trump Reveals How Melania Reacted To His Conviction In The Hush Money Trial\n\nDonald Trump Reveals How Melania Reacted To His Conviction In The Hush Money Trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said his wife, Melania Trump, is doing “fine” after a jury found him guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in his criminal hush money trial in New York last week.\n\nIn an interview with “Fox & Friends Weekend” that aired Sunday, the former president spoke about how his family is processing the news of his conviction.\n\n“I think in many ways it’s tougher on them than it is on me,” he said. “They’re good people, all of them, everyone, everyone. I have a wonderful wife who has to listen to this stuff all the time. They do that for this reason.”\n\nTrump added that while the former first lady has taken the news in stride, it’s still tough for her.\n\n“She’s fine, but I think it’s very hard for her,” he said. “I mean, she’s fine, but you know she has to read all this crap.”\n\nTrump has decried his conviction and pledged to appeal it.\n\nWhile other family members, including Ivanka Trump, who had previously stayed silent about the proceedings, came out with a supportive message for her father following his guilty verdict, Melania Trump has not made any public statements or posts on her personal social media accounts since Thursday.\n\nThe trial centers around a $130,000 payment made to porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election to keep quiet about her story about their alleged affair. Trump denies the affair.\n\nThe proceedings brought up embarrassing details about the former president and his relationship with his wife.\n\nMichael Cohen, the former president’s personal lawyer and “fixer,” who was the prosecution’s star witness, told the court Trump wasn’t concerned about how his wife would react to Daniels going public with her story.\n\n“He wasn’t thinking about Melania,” Cohen said. “This was all about the campaign.”\n\nMeanwhile, Daniels told the court her affair with Trump started shortly after Melania Trump gave birth to the couple’s son, Barron.\n\nDaniels also recalled Donald Trump told her at the time that he and Melania Trump slept in separate bedrooms.\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Mirror published Sunday, Daniels urged Melanie Trump to leave the presumptive GOP presidential nominee.\n\n“I don’t know what their agreement may or may not be, but Melania needs to leave him,” Daniels said. “Not because of what he did with me or other women but because he is a convicted felon.”\n\nMelania Trump has kept a low profile since the end of her husband’s administration, making rare public appearances as Donald Trump campaigns for the White House. She also did not show up at the Manhattan courthouse during the trial, even as other family members and allies joined Trump in court.\n\nHowever, The New York Times reported Melania Trump privately called the trial “a disgrace” amounting to election interference.\n\nDonald Trump’s sentencing hearing has been set for July 11.\n\nRelated...",

Sheila Jackson Lee announced that she has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and is undergoing treatment.\n\nThe Texas Democrat, who is seeking a 16th term, said in a statement late Sunday that as a member of Congress, she has been honored to be a leader in the fight for justice and equality and will approach this more personal fight with faith and courage.\n\n“I am confident that my doctors have developed the best possible plan to target my specific disease,” Jackson Lee said. “The road ahead will not be easy, but I stand in faith that God will strengthen me.”\n\nJackson Lee said that it’s likely that she will be absent from Congress occasionally as she pursues treatment, but that her office will continue to serve constituents.

            "title": "Race to form South Africa’s next government: Who will the ANC ally with?",
            "summary": "The governing party has a range of potential partners. But early negotiations suggest that no deal would be easy.\n\nJohannesburg, South Africa — After suffering a stunning blow in last week’s election, South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) has begun closed-door negotiations with its political opponents to begin talks about forming a coalition government.\n\nOn Sunday, the Electoral Commission (IEC) announced that elections in South Africa were “free and fair” but with no single party gaining an outright majority. The final election results confirmed the ANC’s decline in support to just more than 40 percent of the vote – far less than the absolute majority it had for the past 30 years after bringing about an end to apartheid.\n\nParties have a two-week deadline to elect a president, and analysts said the ANC would likely need to concede to an array of demands to bring others on board for a coalition government.\n\nThe ANC held a meeting of its national leaders on Saturday where they discussed coalition permutations and the possibility of forming a “government of national unity”. Such an arrangement would be reminiscent of the era of former president Nelson Mandela, who led a government of national unity from 1994 until 1997. Mandela was the president, with FW De Klerk, the last apartheid prime minister, as his deputy. Leaders of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) were part of the cabinet.\n\nBut public policy expert Kagiso “TK” Pooe, told Al Jazeera that a government of national unity might only work if built around clear goals that all parties can agree to.\n\n“Key among them will be the economic recovery of the South African economy and promoting employment,” he said. “Secondly curtailing the problem of institutional corruption and inefficiency.” Without the will to commit to such objectives, “the coalition will always be at the precipice of failure and fallout,” he said.\n\nA weakened ANC\n\nThe ANC, in addition to its national setbacks, also lost the majority in three provinces that it currently rules: KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng and the Northern Cape. It suffered its worst blow in KwaZulu-Natal, where former President Jacob Zuma’s MK Party swept up support.\n\nThe centre-right Democratic Alliance, the official opposition, saw marginal growth in its support with 21.8 percent of the vote, and the left-wing Economic Freedom Fights (EFF) saw a dip in their support to 9.5 percent of the vote.\n\nFormer president Jacob Zuma and his uMkhonto we Sizwe Party (MK Party) were the biggest election winners. The party, formed only in late 2023, contested elections for the first time and secured third place with 14.6 percent of the vote. It is now the largest party in KwaZulu-Natal, Zuma’s home province.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the ANC said on Sunday that it had begun exploratory talks with other political parties as it digested the consequences of its plummeting support.\n\n“The ANC is committed to the formation of a government that reflects the will of the people. That is stable, and it can govern effectively,” ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula said at a news conference.\n\nHe sought to call for calm, committing the ANC to act responsibly amid widespread uncertainty.\n\n“The voters of South Africa have shown that they expect the leaders of this country to work together in the interests of all. We will continue to act responsibly, progressively and at all times in the interests of the people of South Africa,” he said. “We will continue to uphold the rule of law and call on all South Africans to respect the laws, rules and codes that govern the conduct of elections.”\n\nAn ANC-DA alliance?\n\nThe ANC is scheduled to have several top-level meetings this week to try to crystalise its coalition plans.\n\nOne option could be to strike a deal with the DA — traditionally its main opponent. A coalition involving South Africa’s largest and most mainstream parties could be more stable than partnerships with newer, more radical formations, many analysts have said. Both parties are also more conservative economically than the MK Party and the EFF, which espouse left-leaning policies.\n\nThe DA on Sunday announced that it would begin talks with the ANC in an effort to block what some have described as a “doomsday coalition” between the ANC, EFF and MK Party.\n\n“I, too, am a father to three young daughters. And, like millions of other South Africans, I do not want them to grow up in a country run by a party like MK, that wants to abolish the constitution which so many fought and died for, that wants to subvert the judiciary, and that plans to expropriate all private property and nationalise the Reserve Bank,” DA leader John Steenhuisen said in a briefing. “These are the things contained in the manifestos of the EFF and MK.”\n\nThe DA has set up a high-level team to manage talks with the ANC.\n\nBut stitching together an ANC-DA coalition will not be easy.\n\nLukhona Mnguni, a political analyst, said the ANC and the DA’s constituencies are “fundamentally opposed to each other”.\n\n“If they position it as a quasi-government of national unity, then it may have an opportunity to work,” he said.\n\nMnguni said that, as far back as 2018, business leaders touted an ANC-DA coalition as a more stable option for the country.\n\n“Both parties are conservative when it comes to making bold and audacious decisions when it comes to economic policy. They may disagree on other issues like foreign policy, which will be difficult to negotiate,” he said.\n\nThe EFF – which seeks the expropriation of land from minority white farmers without compensation – said it was open to a deal with the ANC. “We want to work with the ANC because the ANC, when compromised, they are not arrogant,” EFF party leader Julius Malema told journalists over the weekend.\n\nHowever, business leaders and investors have expressed wariness at the possibility of an ANC-EFF coalition because of the EFF’s leftist positions.\n\n“We are not going to support an administration that is touting policies of mass economic destruction,” Busisiwe Mavuso, CEO of Business Leadership South Africa (BLSA), told local media.\n\nThe IFP, the country’s fifth-largest party, has said it too is open to talks with the ANC.\n\nMeanwhile, the MK said it was open to talks with the ANC — but not with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in charge.\n\nThe MK Party has also alleged that the election had been rigged, even though it has emerged as the biggest gainer from the polls.\n\nThe party – which has made calls to abolish the supremacy of South Africa’s constitution and replace it with “unfettered parliamentary sovereignty” – also threatened violence on Sunday over the election results.\n\nWriting in his weekly newsletter on Monday morning, Ramaphosa rejected those threats.\n\n“As we work as political parties to find each other across the divide in the coming weeks and months, let us demonstrate both in our actions and our utterances that we hold the constitution and the rule of law to be paramount,” he wrote. “Let us remember that whatever authority, whatever power we are entrusted with, must be exercised to advance the interests of the South African people.\n\n“Now more than ever, we need to put our differences aside and work together for the common good,” he said.\n\nBut the election verdict has not only exposed the deep political fissures among South Africa’s parties — it could also set off internal scrutiny within the ANC, said Pooe.\n\n“I think the ANC has been severely dented. I certainly have no doubt that they have been shocked. They have been disappointed,” he said. “The next [ANC] national executive committee meeting will be a very tense discretion and postmortem of this election, which may make or break the party.”",

More recently, the stock’s prior all-time high at $164.46 has provided a level of support during a steep retracement, though trading volumes remain below average compared to earlier this year, indicating weakening momentum.\n\nAmid further downside, investors should monitor the $133 level, an area on the chart where the price may find support from the triangle’s top trendline that closely aligns with the 50-week moving average (MA). A failure to hold this key level could see the shares revisit lower support near the 200-week MA, currently sitting at $104.73.\n\nAMD shares were up 1.4% at $169.30 at around around 7:30 a.m. ET.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

            "summary": "CNN —\n\nChicago Sky guard Chennedy Carter has been at the center of a social media firestorm for her off-ball foul against Caitlin Clark in the third quarter of the game against Indiana Fever Saturday.\n\nMany critics argue that Carter appeared to go out of her way to throw her hip and shoulder into Clark, whose back was turned and who tumbled to the ground after the foul.\n\nA day later, the WNBA upgraded the foul called against Carter to a Flagrant 1, which the league defines as “unnecessary and/or excessive contact committed by a player against an opponent.”\n\nClark’s Fever team went on to defeat the Sky 71-70 in the hard-fought game.\n\nAfterwards Carter refused to address the foul, telling reporters: “I ain’t answering no Caitlin Clark questions.”\n\nFever’s general manager Lin Dunn posted on X, suggesting there’s a “difference between tough defense and unnecessary — targeting actions!”\n\n“It needs to stop! The league needs to “ cleanup” the crap! That’s NOT who this league is!! continued Dunn on X.\n\nCNN has contacted the WNBA for comment.\n\nFor her part, Clark said of the foul in her postgame media conference: “It is what it is. I feel like I’m just at the point where you accept it and don’t retaliate. Just let them hit you, be what it is, don’t let it get inside your head and know it’s coming.\n\n“I think at this point I know I’m going to take a couple of hard shots a game and that’s what it is. I’m trying not to let it bother me and just stay in the game and stay in what’s important because usually it’s the second person that gets caught if you retaliate.\n\nClark hits the floor after Carter's off-ball foul on the Fever guard. Brian Spurlock/Icon Sportswire/AP\n\n“So I’m just trying to stay in the game and focus on my team and focus on what’s important.”\n\nHowever, Fever coach Christie Sides later took to social media to demand the WNBA take action over the “unacceptable” situation.\n\nCarter’s teammate Angel Reese, who was seen clapping and hugging Carter after the foul, was fined $1,000 by the WNBA for refusing to make herself available to the media following the game, the league also announced Sunday.\n\nThe Sky organization was also fined $5,000 for failing to ensure that all players comply with league media policies.\n\nCNN has contacted Chicago Sky for comment.\n\nThe Fever fell to 2-9 on the season after a 104-68 loss to the New York Liberty on Sunday. Clark, who was 1-for-10 shooting, finished with three points.",

            "title": "As Joe Pavelski’s storied career perhaps comes to an end, Stars lament missed opportunity",
            "summary": "EDMONTON — Tyler Seguin’s voice caught. Wyatt Johnston’s eyes watered. Pete DeBoer’s face sank.\n\nComing this close to the Stanley Cup Final and coming up short was excruciating. Feeling like they had failed Joe Pavelski was somehow worse.\n\n“Don’t ask about Joe,” Seguin said with a sad laugh as he welled up a bit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Sunday night’s 2-1 loss to the Edmonton Oilers in Game 6 of the Western Conference final was the last game of Pavelski’s career — and it sure sounded like a real possibility based on the way his teammates spoke of him afterward — it’ll be a tough one to swallow. Pavelski had a postseason to forget, with just one goal and three assists in 19 games. The man with 1,068 career regular-season points and 143 more in the playoffs didn’t register a single one in the Oilers series.\n\nBut his impact on the Stars these last five seasons was immeasurable.\n\n“Since Day 1, since he’s been in here, he’s meant everything to our group — on the ice, off the ice, all our golf games,” Seguin said. “He’s improved all of those. Just an amazing person to have in here.”\n\nDeBoer called it “the absolute privilege of my coaching career to coach a guy like that.” Captain Jamie Benn called him an “all-time teammate.” And Johnston, who at 21 years old is barely half Pavelski’s age (the veteran turns 40 next month), was in tears when discussing the man whose family he’s lived with since entering the NHL.\n\n“I can’t thank him and his family enough for what they’ve done for me,” Johnston said.\n\nJoe Pavelski didn’t register a single point in the Stars’ playoffs series vs. the Oilers. (Leila Devlin / Getty Images)\n\nIt was another near-miss in a career full of them for Pavelski. He reached the Stanley Cup Final twice, once with the San Jose Sharks in 2016 and once with the Stars in the 2020 bubble here in Edmonton, but his teams were constantly contenders. You don’t play in 201 career playoff games by accident.\n\nAnd Pavelski’s not the only veteran who lost a golden opportunity for a first championship. Ryan Suter is 39, Benn is 34 and Matt Duchene is 33. There will be more chances for those last three, for sure, as the Stars are built for the present and the future. But this was the top team in the Western Conference, a team that checked every box with its talent, its depth, its structure, its blue line, its goaltending. It was supposed to be their year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut an 0-for-14 performance on the power play, coupled with four power-play goals allowed in Games 5 and 6, doomed them to another offseason of what-ifs. The Stars outshot the Oilers 35-10 in Game 6, the largest shot differential and the fewest shots ever allowed in a series-clinching loss. Right up until the very end, as they peppered Oilers goaltender Stuart Skinner with shots in a frantic six-on-five, they believed they would somehow win the game, the series and the Stanley Cup.\n\n“Hockey’s hard, you know?” Seguin said. “You need a lot of things to go right. You need to have that opportunity. We had that opportunity. We went through a gantlet and beat some really good teams (Vegas and Colorado) and knew we had something special. Lost to a team that we thought we could beat, and sometimes that’s the playoffs. Sometimes it’s that one bounce, one goal, one save. That’s why we all love it. That’s why this is the hardest damn trophy in the world to win.”\n\nJohnston, in just his second postseason, has years of chances ahead of him. And even if the Stars start shedding some veterans through attrition and free agency, he believes the team is well set up for future runs.\n\n“A lot of really good guys who have a lot of hockey ahead,” Johnston said. “And even our older guys have a lot of really good hockey ahead of them. It’s hard to look into the future right now and look past (tonight), but it’s definitely exciting.”\n\nSeguin was all raw emotion in the wake of the loss, a mix of appreciation and devastation. Hockey’s like that.\n\n“There’s a lot of emotion right now, a lot of disappointing, but heck yeah, (we) had a ton of fun, too,” he said. “We had a blast being in these big moments, guys grinding, and the ups and downs. I love this s—. So that was awesome. … Unfortunately, you have to lose a lot to win in this league. I don’t know why it’s like that, but (you have to) learn some lessons, keep this taste, and get ready for next year.”\n\n(Top photo of Joe Pavelski and Connor McDavid: Codie McLachlan / Getty Images)",
